## Converting to Jekyll

* Convert sitemap.txt so that it’s output as html

* Convert RSS feed

* Continue converting blog layout

* Why aren’t apostrophes showing correctly? They’re showing as â€™

## Other

* Display the date in the /blog listing. There's currently no indication of when something was written and it took me a while to work out how to find that information.

* Use a clearer date format on a single blog post. It's currently, for example, "Thu, 12 Apr 12".
