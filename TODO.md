## Converting to Jekyll

* Use html tidy, or simmilar, to tidy the html of the Webby and Jekyll versions of the site, before comparing the output. I'm aiming for them to be as close as possible before switching to Jekyll.

* Can I avoid emitting the post URLs with the .html file extension?

* Consider writing a liquid filter to generate the exact same timestamp format in commit titled "Replace short_date helper"

## Other

* Display the date in the /blog listing. There's currently no indication of when something was written and it took me a while to work out how to find that information.

* Use a clearer date format on a single blog post. It's currently, for example, "Thu, 12 Apr 12".
