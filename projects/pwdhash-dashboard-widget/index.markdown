A [dashboard](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dashboard_(software)) widget that’s identical in functionality to [pwdhash.com](http://pwdhash.com). I find it useful when a website I’m signed up to also offers client-side, other than a browser, access to their service ([twitter](http://twitter.com), for example).

See the [introductory blog post](/articles/2008-05-19-pwdhash-widget) for a little more information.
