A ["dashboard":http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dashboard_(software)] widget that's identical in functionality to "pwdhash.com":http://pwdhash.com.  I find it useful when a website I'm signed up to also offers client-side, other than a browser, access to their service ("twitter":http://twitter.com, for example).

See the "introductory blog post":/articles/2008-05-19-pwdhash-widget for a little more information.
