## [Http Request Headers](/utilities/http-request-headers)

A page that clearly displays the HTTP Request Headers sent by your browser. See [Using SSI to expose Http request headers sent by your browser](/blog/2009-01-06-using-ssi-to-expose-http-request-headers-sent-by-your-browser) for more info.

## [Querystring printer](/utilities/querystring-printer)

A little utility that I use to help me debug Apache mod\_rewrite rules. See [A Javascript Querystring printer](/blog/2008-12-05-a-javascript-querystring-printer) for more info.

## [Html Generator](/utilities/html-generator)

A very simple little html editor thingy. Type some html into a textbox, select the doctype and view the complete source along with a rendered preview. See [A simple utility to generate and preview html on the web](/blog/2009-01-06-a-simple-utility-to-generate-and-preview-html-on-the-web) for a little more info.
