  So.  What does that mean exactly?  Well, right at the moment, not a great deal.  It pretty much means that you can add the ability to search reevoo.com to the Firefox 2 and IE7 browsers very easily.  Visiting "reevoo.com":http://www.reevoo.com with either of these browsers will highlight part of the 'search box'.

  IE 7 changes the little arrow to a goldy, orangey, yellowy type colour to indicate the presence of an opensearch enabled search engine.

  While Firefox 2 opts for a blue surround and additionally chooses to add our logo.  Woot.

  h2. I appreciate that I can now easily search reevoo from anywhere but was it really worth a blog post?

  Hmm, interesting question (that wasn't an actual question, I just made it up).

  Actually, I think that "opensearch":http://www.opensearch.org is pretty cool.  At the moment, we are just exposing our search results in their html form.  Just imagine, for a second, that we were instead, exposing our results as "atom":http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atom_%28standard%29 or "rss":http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RSS_%28file_format%29 feeds.  Now, also imagine[1] that retailers felt like being a little more open; and, as such, were offering an opensearch description of their search capabilities, along with search results in atom or rss feeds.  All we'd need then was an "aggregator":http://a9.com that would allow us to search for products across our chosen retailers and reevoo in one go.  The result would be a page containing both product reviews and pricing and stock availability from each retailer.  That, I think, would be pretty damn cool.

  fn1. Currently, this requires a lot of imagination.  A quick browse this afternoon found four big retailers that don't even have working search without javascript enabled.  At least they've got "well":http://www.w3.org/Provider/Style/URI "designed":http://wiki.welldesignedurls.org/Main_Page urls.  Oh, hang on...
