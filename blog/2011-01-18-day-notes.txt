  [James A](http://interblah.net/), [James M](http://jamesmead.org/), [Tom](http://tomafro.net/) and I spent the day at the [O2](http://www.o2.co.uk/) offices in Slough.  We spent some more time trying to connect to the live MMSC and talking about how we might integrate MMS functionality within [#blue](https://hashblue.com/).
