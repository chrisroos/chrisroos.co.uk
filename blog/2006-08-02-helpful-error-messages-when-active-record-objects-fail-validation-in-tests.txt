  I "posted":/blog/2006-06-21-more-helpful-messages-for-active-record-validation-errors-in-rails-testing a while back about displaying the reasons for an active record model failing validation.

  I knew the code was hacky and nasty but didn't realise quite how bad until I noticed how "simply":http://dev.rubyonrails.org/browser/tags/rel_1-1-0/activerecord/lib/active_record/validations.rb  (1 line) the same thing was implemented in "Rails 1.1":http://weblog.rubyonrails.com/2006/3/28/rails-1-1-rjs-active-record-respond_to-integration-tests-and-500-other-things (and above).

  Although it's only useful for people still on Rails 1.0, I made a quick plugin that backports this change.  I don't really want to put it in my subversion repository, so have just pasted the necessary code below.

  <pre class="code ruby">
  # File init.rb
  require File.dirname(__FILE__) + '/lib/record_invalid'
  </pre>

  <pre class="code ruby">
  # File record_invalid.rb
  module ActiveRecord

    class RecordInvalid < ActiveRecordError
      def initialize(record)
        @record = record
        super("Validation failed: \#{@record.errors.full_messages.join(", ")}")
      end
    end

  end
  </pre>

  To create a plugin from this, create the following structure in your rails_app/vendor/plugins directory.

  <pre class="code">
  active_record_validation_error/
  |
  |--init.rb (copy contents of code above)
  |
  |--lib/
     |
     |--record_invalid.rb (copy content of code above)
  </pre>
