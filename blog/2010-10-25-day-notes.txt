  Resumed an investigation into an [envjs](http://github.com/smparkes/env-js) problem that [Jase](http://jasoncale.com/) and I start on Friday.

  Ripped out a whole load of javascript functionality from [hashblue](http://hashblue.com) which meant we no longer ran into the envjs problem.

  We noticed that we were incorrectly returning html with a content-type of text/javascript (through our use of respond_to and wants.js).  Fixing this actually fixed another problem we'd been seeing in [Chrome](http://www.google.com/chrome).  It seems that something deep within [jquery](http://jquery.com/) was trying to parse the html as javascript and raising this exception: "Uncaught SyntaxError: Unexpected token <".

  We ran into ran into the problem described in [Rails lighthouse ticket 5247](https://rails.lighthouseapp.com/projects/8994/tickets/5247-assert_template-wrong-behavior-for-testing-layout-used-to-render-template).  We wanted to use the broken behaviour so created the [action_controller_template_assertions_ticket_5247](http://github.com/freerange/action_controller_template_assertions_ticket_5247) gem to monkey patch the broken method.
