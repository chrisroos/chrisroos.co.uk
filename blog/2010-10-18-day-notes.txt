  Started using a shared [keychain](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Keychain_\(Mac_OS\)) file (stored in shared [dropbox](https://www.dropbox.com/) instead of a password protected dmg containing a text file full of passwords.

  Worked with [Tom](http://tomafro.net/) to start migrating the hosting of an app from [linode](http://www.linode.com/) to [AWS](http://aws.amazon.com/).

  O2 meeting with [Kalv](http://kalv.co.uk/).

  Worked with [James A](http://www.interblah.net/) to get a performance testing story accepted.

  Played around with the security command line tool to extract a private key from a secure note in the keychain.  You'll need something like this if you want to do the same.

        $ security find-generic-password -g -l "my-label" 2>&1 1>/dev/null | ruby -e 'puts STDIN.read[/-----BEGIN PRIVATE KEY-----.*-----END PRIVATE KEY-----/].gsub(/\\012/, "\n")' > ~/path-to-key
