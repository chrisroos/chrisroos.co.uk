This is the raw content of chrisroos.co.uk and these instructions are only really ever going to mean something to me...

## Building the site

    $ webby build
    
## Forcing a rebuild of the site

    $ webby rebuild

    $ webby deploy
  
## Creating a new post

    $ webby create:post blog/"<title of post with spaces>"
