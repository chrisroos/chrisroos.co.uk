# Intro

This is the raw content of chrisroos.co.uk and these instructions are only really ever going to mean something to me...

## Building the site

    $ webby build
    
## Forcing a rebuild of the site

    $ webby rebuild
    
## Deploying the site (this forces a rebuild first)

    $ webby deploy
  
## Creating a new post

    $ webby create:post blog/"<title of post with spaces>"
    
## Creating a new day note

    $ webby create:post blog/2010-10-14-day-notes
    # Change the title attribute of that post to 'Day notes - Thurs 14th Oct 2010'
