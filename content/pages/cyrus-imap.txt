I've spent some time today looking into getting [Cyrus Imap](http://asg.web.cmu.edu/cyrus/) installed on [FreeBsd](http://www.freebsd.org) 5.3R.

I haven't got too far yet but think I've probably learned a few things I didn't know.

Initially I just installed cyrus-imap from the ports and left it with all the default values. Once I had this and played around a bit, I un-installed and started re-installing the [cyrus-sasl](http://asg.web.cmu.edu/sasl/) library manually, playing with various configuration options.

When installed using the default options, all of the following 'plugins' are installed in .

-   liblogin
-   libanonymous
-   libcrammd5
-   libdigestmd5
-   libgssapiv2
-   libntlm
-   libotp
-   libplain
-   libsasldb

My preference at this stage is to get the imap server running with plaintext passwords over a TLS encrypted pipe. As such I started looking at the options available to <code>configure</code>. Some of the options seem to be represented in the Makefile so my first approach was to 'disable' them on the command line.

```
$ make -DWITHOUT_OTP -DWITHOUT_CRAM -DWITHOUT_DIGEST -DWITHOUT_GSSAPI
```

I also really wanted to disable anonymous access (which I could see how to do in the options in <code>configure</code> but not in the Makefile) but I ignored that for now.

When installed, having been built with the above options, I had all of the above 'plugins' except the following.

-   libcrammd5
-   libdigestmd5
-   libgssapiv2
-   libotp

This was better but I still had some 'plugins' that I didn't really want. Once again, I un-installed the sasl port and this time built it passing arguments directly to <code>configure</code>.

```
$ make CONFIGURE_ARGS+='--disable-cram --disable-digest --disable-otp --disable-gssapi --disable-anon'
```

This time I ended up with just the libplain and libsasldb 'plugins' which seems much closer to what I want - at least I think it does based on my very very limited knowledge at present.
