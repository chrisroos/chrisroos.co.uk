Wait, this isn't what I was expecting
=====================================

It used to be possible to view all posts from a certain day, month and year. I really don't think there's any value in these pages so they've gone :-)

If you really want to look at everything I posted on a given day, month or year then you can use google, searching for <a href="http://www.google.com/search?q=site%3Ablog.seagul.co.uk%2Farticles%2F2008-05-19">site:blog.seagul.co.uk/articles/2008-05-19</a> would give you all posts from the 19th of May 2008, for example.
