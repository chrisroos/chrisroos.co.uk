Just a polite request to those that publish only partial content in their feeds. Please don't do it.

I used to read my feeds offline in [Google Reader](http://www.google.com/reader). Partial feeds are frustrating because they suck me in with a teaser and then leave me hanging until I get back to an Internet connection: where I'll often forget about the feed and leave it forever. Alternatively, I'll visit said page offline, bookmark it in delicious ([firefox extension](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/3615)) with a to-read tag and still never read it<sup class="footnote" id="fnr1"><a href="#fn1">1</a></sup>.

I now tend to read feeds on my [G1](http://www.t-mobileg1.com/) (still in Google Reader). Switching between interfaces on the G1 isn't quite as seamless as switching between tabs in a browser: It disrupts my flow. I think the same argument applies to google reader in a standard browser: I'm happily reading things that look the same until I come across some partial content, click a link and go blind because someone's decided that white on black in easy to read.

So there you have it. The evidence<sup class="footnote" id="fnr2"><a href="#fn2">2</a></sup> supports the fact that you should publish full content in your feeds. Now go do it.

<p class="footnote" id="fn1">

<a href="#fnr1"><sup>1</sup></a> This is worse because I end up with a whole bunch of bookmarks that say 'page could not be loaded', or similar, and I then have to worry about fixing them up to make them pretty (I've been doing this for over a year so just imagine how heavy this is on my shoulders right now).
