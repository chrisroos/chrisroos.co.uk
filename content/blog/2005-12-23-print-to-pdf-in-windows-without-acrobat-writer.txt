  (Probably) the standard way to print to "Pdf":http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PDF in Windows is to buy "Adobe Acrobat":http://www.adobe.com/products/acrobat/main.html or use one of the alternatives (which come with various different licences and are of varying quality; from experience over the last couple of years).

  There is, however, a completely free alternative, providing you don't mind going through a couple of steps to implement it (which I don't).

  The basic premise is that you print to "PostScript":http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PostScript using a PostScript compatible printer driver and then use "Ghostscript":http://www.cs.wisc.edu/~ghost/ to convert from PostScript to Pdf.

  These instructions work in Windows XP but should be very similar in all versions of Windows.

  h2. Install PostScript compatible printer.

  # Add a Printer.
  # Choose 'Local printer' and do not 'automatically detect'.
  # Select 'FILE: (Print to File)' in the list next to 'Use the following port'.
  # Choose a PS printer.  I'm currently using HP Color LaserJet PS.
  # Select whether you want to use this as your default printer and choose no to printing a test page.

  h2. Download and install AFPL Ghostscript

  # Visit the "Ghostscript site":http://www.cs.wisc.edu/~ghost/ and follow the 'Obtaining AFPL Ghostscript <version>' link.
  # Download the version for Windows, which at the time of writing is called  gs853w32.exe.
  # Double click the downloaded file to install.  Use the defaults during installation.

  h2. Download and install GSview

  # Visit the "GSview site":http://www.cs.wisc.edu/~ghost/gsview/index.htm and follow the 'Obtaining GSview 4.7 link'.
  # Download the version for Windows, which at the time of writing is called  gsv47w32.exe.
  # Double click the downloaded file to install.  Use the defaults during installation.

  h2. Print something

  # Open a file and choose to print to your PostScript printer.
  # On clicking the Print button, you will be prompted to specify a filename to save the PostScript document to.  Supply the full path to the file here, for example 'c:\page.ps'.  Although the .ps extension is optional it makes it easier to open directly in GSview if this is supplied.

  h2. Convert the PostScript file to Pdf

  # Double click on the 'c:\page.ps' file to open it in GSview.
  # Click OK to close the software registration prompt and you will see the PostScript interpretation of your file on the screen.
  # Click File > Convert and choose 'pdfwrite' as the device, a suitable resolution (default of 600 should be fine) and click OK.  You will be prompted to save the converted Pdf file somewhere
  # Enter the filename to save the file with, noting that .pdf doesn't get added automatically, e.g. specify page.pdf.
  # Open the new .pdf file in either "Adobe Reader":http://www.adobe.com/products/acrobat/readstep2.html or "an alternative":/blog/2005-11-13-windows-adobe-acrobat-reader-alternative
