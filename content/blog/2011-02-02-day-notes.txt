  [Tom](http://tomafro.net/) and I fixed a couple of small bugs in [#blue](https://hashblue.com/):

  * Invite URLs had changed and some of the older ones were no longer working.  We added a legacy route to ensure the old invites continued to work.
  * It was possible to access the new account page without an invite.

  We worked through some network shenanigans to allow us to communicate with the [O2](http://www.o2.co.uk/) abs so that we can start provisioning customers again.
