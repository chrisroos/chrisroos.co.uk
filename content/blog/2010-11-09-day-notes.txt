Spent the day remote pairing with [Jase](http://jasoncale.com/) (he was already over in Belfast for [Build conference](http://buildconf.com/)) on [Caffeine Monitor](http://cm.buildconf.com/).  The original markup had been designed for a fixed resolution but it became clear (to be fair it probably should've become clear more than one day before the conference) that we'd need to support more than just the one resolution.  We had to redo some of the markup and css and Jase added some [media queries](http://www.w3.org/TR/css3-mediaqueries/) to ensure that it looked OK on smaller screens too.
