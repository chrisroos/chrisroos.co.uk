So. What does that mean exactly? Well, right at the moment, not a great deal. It pretty much means that you can add the ability to search reevoo.com to the Firefox 2 and IE7 browsers very easily. Visiting [reevoo.com](http://www.reevoo.com) with either of these browsers will highlight part of the 'search box'.

IE 7 changes the little arrow to a goldy, orangey, yellowy type colour to indicate the presence of an opensearch enabled search engine.

While Firefox 2 opts for a blue surround and additionally chooses to add our logo. Woot.

I appreciate that I can now easily search reevoo from anywhere but was it really worth a blog post?

Hmm, interesting question (that wasn't an actual question, I just made it up).

Actually, I think that [opensearch](http://www.opensearch.org) is pretty cool. At the moment, we are just exposing our search results in their html form. Just imagine, for a second, that we were instead, exposing our results as [atom](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atom_%28standard%29) or [rss](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RSS_%28file_format%29) feeds. Now, also imagine<sup class="footnote" id="fnr1"><a href="#fn1">1</a></sup> that retailers felt like being a little more open; and, as such, were offering an opensearch description of their search capabilities, along with search results in atom or rss feeds. All we'd need then was an [aggregator](http://a9.com) that would allow us to search for products across our chosen retailers and reevoo in one go. The result would be a page containing both product reviews and pricing and stock availability from each retailer. That, I think, would be pretty damn cool.

<p class="footnote" id="fn1">

<a href="#fnr1"><sup>1</sup></a> Currently, this requires a lot of imagination. A quick browse this afternoon found four big retailers that don't even have working search without javascript enabled. At least they've got <a href="http://www.w3.org/Provider/Style/URI">well</a> <a href="http://wiki.welldesignedurls.org/Main_Page">designed</a> urls. Oh, hang on...
