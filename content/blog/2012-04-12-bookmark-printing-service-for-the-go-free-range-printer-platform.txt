I've spent the last couple of days creating a simple service for the [Printer platform][].  This service allows you to print a bookmark (in the traditional sense) for the book you're reading.  Although it's probably of most use to those people with their own printers, you can definitely have a play with generating your own bookmarks (and see a printed example) over on the [Printer bookmarks app on Heroku][].

The idea of a book-specific bookmark, on which I can record when I start and finish along with some reading notes, appeals to me.  I can actually imagine that a custom bookmark printing service like this might be useful outside of this little experiment with the Printer platform.

Developing this little bookmark application ([source on github][]) allowed me to use the Printer platform in anger, which was great as I'd only really been following [James A][]'s impressive work from the sidelines.

## Building the bookmark service

The rest of this post is a fairly high level view of how I approached the development of this little service.  Hopefully I'll convey how simple it is to build your own Printer service.

I started by looking at the example [Printer Mail][], [Printer Paint][] and [Printer Weather][] apps.  While these services are geared toward sending content (from a person in the case of mail and paint, and from a machine in the case of weather) to another person's printer, I think the bookmark service is most useful for someone wanting to print to their own printer.  This made my life a little easier as it meant I didn't need to worry about storing printer details in my app: I could rely on the user entering their printer address at the time they wanted to print the bookmark.

The first thing I did was create a simple html bookmark (see [7652ba][]) that I could preview using the [Printer API][] (you can think of the Printer API as something like [Google Cloud Print][] for receipt printers).  Once happy that the preview looked OK I moved on to making the bookmark dynamic based on a supplied Amazon URL (see [3f5377][]).  The addition of some tests allowed me to refactor the code in preparation for the simple Sinatra web interface (see [a75e4a][]).  Once able to view the bookmarks in a browser I wanted them to look a little closer to how they'd look once printed.  Fortunately, I was able to borrow the template from the Printer Mail app to do just that (see [0ba536][]).  I had the app deployed to [Heroku][] by this time so I was "done" in the most simple of senses: I could use the publicly accessible bookmark preview (e.g. [bookmark for The Da Vinci Code][]) to print to the [Go Free Range Printer backend][].  After that, apart from making it easier to print (see [d84b75][]) and preview (see [617d24][]) bookmarks, the remainder of the changes were mainly aesthetic.  Pretty simple, huh.
