One Friday in September 2008 I had the bright idea (I don't remember where the inspiration came from) of slurping down images from the [webcam that points at Ramsgate's outer harbour](http://www.portoframsgate.co.uk/portoframsgate/welcome_to_the_marina/web_cam.aspx). I used a combination of [curl](http://curl.haxx.se/) and [cron](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cron) to download one image a minute for 24 hours starting around 14:30 on the Friday (2,678 images in total). My intention was always to combine these into a little [time-lapse](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Time-lapse) movie and I finally got around to it last week (just the three months late then). I played around with various ways to produce the movie (including [iMovie](http://www.apple.com/ilife/imovie/), [ffmpeg](http://ffmpeg.mplayerhq.hu/) and others that I no longer remember) but couldn't get the output I was after. A little more searching revealed that [Quicktime Pro](http://www.apple.com/quicktime/pro/) could do exactly what I was after (I'm afraid I can't find the original post I read about it) so I stumped up the Â£20 and made my video. I opted for 60 frames per second which results in a video of around 45 seconds which seems OK to me. I chose to host it at [vimeo](http://vimeo.com) because I prefer the simplicity of their interface over [youtube](http://youtube.com) (as I'm writing this I realised I probably could've hosted it at [flickr](http://flickr.com) too).

I'm embedding it below (or you can see it at [vimeo](http://vimeo.com/2743072)) ~~but you'll have to excuse the large amount of whitespace between this paragraph and the video. I've had a real quick look but I'm tired and really can't work out what's causing it.~~ [Adem](http://www.ademweb.co.uk/blog) spotted what I'd done wrong and the whitespace has now been removed.

I love being able to see the massive volume of water that moves in and out of the harbour entrance raising and lowering the boats as it pleases.
