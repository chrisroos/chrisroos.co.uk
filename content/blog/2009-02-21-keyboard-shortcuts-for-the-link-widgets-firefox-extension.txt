  I'm posting this because I couldn't find the keyboard shortcuts listed anywhere and ended up having to dig into the source of the "Link Widgets":https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/2933 extension to find them.

  * First - Shift + Alt + Page Up
  * Previous - Alt + Page Up
  * Next - Alt + Page Down
  * Last - Shift + Alt + Page Down
  * Up a level - Alt + Up
  * Up to root level - Shift + Alt + Up

  These certainly work on the Mac.  There are another set of shortcuts that make use of the "accel key":http://www.mozilla.org/unix/customizing.html#keys but I didn't play around trying to get them to work.

  * First - Shift + Accel + ,
  * Previous - Accel + ,
  * Next - Accel + .
  * Last - Shift + Accel + .
