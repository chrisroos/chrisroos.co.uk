  I spent quite a while investigating a problem with installing [Nokogiri](https://github.com/tenderlove/nokogiri/).  It turned out to be a problem with a version of [libiconv](http://www.gnu.org/software/libiconv/) I had installed.  I added some details to [Nokogiri issue 381](https://github.com/tenderlove/nokogiri/issues/#issue/381/comment/706790).
