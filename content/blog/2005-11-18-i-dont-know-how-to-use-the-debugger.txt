I currently use [Ruby](http://www.ruby-lang.org) and [Rails](http://www.rubyonrails.com) all day, every day, at [work](http://www.revieworld.com). It's great.

Now, I don't actually know how to use the Ruby debugger; I've taken a look at it in the past and am sure I could use it; it's just that I've never had the need.

As with lots of things, I've been meaning to take a more detailed look for a while; mainly so that I could say 'I know how to use that'. Then, this morning, I realised that maybe it wasn't such a bad thing not to know. If I can develop software that works<sup class="footnote" id="fnr1"><a href="#fn1">1</a></sup> without the help of the debugger<sup class="footnote" id="fnr2"><a href="#fn2">2</a></sup> then, unless the need arises, why bother?

<p class="footnote" id="fn1">

<a href="#fnr1"><sup>1</sup></a> It works when the tests pass.

</p>
<p class="footnote" id="fn2">

<a href="#fnr2"><sup>2</sup></a> But very much with the help of unit tests.
