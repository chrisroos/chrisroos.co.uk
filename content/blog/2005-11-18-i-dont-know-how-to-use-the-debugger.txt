I currently use "Ruby":http://www.ruby-lang.org and "Rails":http://www.rubyonrails.com all day, every day, at "work":http://www.revieworld.com.  It's great.

Now, I don't actually know how to use the Ruby debugger; I've taken a look at it in the past and am sure I could use it; it's just that I've never had the need.

As with lots of things, I've been meaning to take a more detailed look for a while; mainly so that I could say 'I know how to use that'.  Then, this morning, I realised that maybe it wasn't such a bad thing not to know.  If I can develop software that works[1] without the help of the debugger[2] then, unless the need arises, why bother?

fn1. It works when the tests pass.

fn2. But very much with the help of unit tests.
