I currently use "Ruby":http://www.ruby-lang.org and "Rails":http://www.rubyonrails.com all day, every day, at "work":http://www.revieworld.com.  It's great.

Now, I don't actually know how to use the Ruby debugger; I've taken a look at it in the past and am sure I could use it; it's just that I've never had the need.

As with lots of things, I've been meaning to take a more detailed look for a while; mainly so that I could say 'I know how to use that'.  Then, this morning, I realised that maybe it wasn't such a bad thing not to know.  If I can develop software that works<sup class="footnote" id="fnr1"><a href="#fn1">1</a></sup> without the help of the debugger<sup class="footnote" id="fnr2"><a href="#fn2">2</a></sup> then, unless the need arises, why bother?

<p class="footnote" id="fn1"><a href="#fnr1"><sup>1</sup></a> It works when the tests pass.</p>

<p class="footnote" id="fn2"><a href="#fnr2"><sup>2</sup></a> But very much with the help of unit tests.</p>
