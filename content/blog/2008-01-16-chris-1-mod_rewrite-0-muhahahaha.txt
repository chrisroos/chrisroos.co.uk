  I've now spent quite a considerable amount of time trying to get "mod_rewrite":http://httpd.apache.org/docs/1.3/mod/mod_rewrite.html to do my bidding and I think I might just have cracked it[1].

  h2. The requirements

  * Permanently redirect (301) and requests for www.the-local-paper.co.uk to the-local-paper.co.uk
  * Permanently redirect any requests for <code>/index.html</code> to <code>/</code>
  * Permanently redirect any requests for <code>/<article>.html</code> to <code>/<article></code>
  * Render the corresponding <code>/<article>.html</code> for any requests for <code>/<article></code>
  * Hide .svn directories as the entire site is checked out from "subversion":http://subversion.tigris.org/

  h2. The mod_rewrite rules

  <pre class="code">
  # Permanently (301) redirect /index.html to / (regex copied from http://www.webmasterworld.com/apache/3155094.htm)
  RewriteCond %{THE_REQUEST} ^[A-Z]{3,9}\ /.*index\.html\ HTTP/
  RewriteRule ^(.*)index\.html$ $1 [R=301,L]

  # Permanently (301) redirect /<article>.html to /<article>, ensuring that we don't try to redirect index.html to index
  RewriteCond %{THE_REQUEST} .+/[0-9]{4}/[0-9]{2}/[0-9]{2}/.+\.html\ HTTP/
  RewriteCond %{THE_REQUEST} !index\.html\ HTTP/
  RewriteRule ^(.*)\.html$ $1 [R=301,L]

  # If we receive a request for an article without a .html extension then let's rewrite internally to render the file with the .html extension
  RewriteCond %{REQUEST_URI} .+/[0-9]{4}/[0-9]{2}/[0-9]{2}/.+$
  RewriteCond %{REQUEST_URI} !\.html$
  RewriteRule ^(.*)$ $1.html [L]

  # Permanently (301) remove www.
  RewriteCond %{HTTP_HOST} ^www.the-local-paper.co.uk$ [NC]
  RewriteRule ^(.*)$ http://the-local-paper.co.uk/$1 [R=301,L]

  # Block access to the .svn directories
  <DirectoryMatch "^/.*/\.svn/">
    ErrorDocument 403 /404.html
    Order allow,deny
    Deny from all
    Satisfy All
  </DirectoryMatch>
  </pre>

  I figured that there's a chance some of these rules might come in useful to someone else.

  fn1. This has all been for the "local paper idea":/blog/2007-06-01-an-open-letter-to-my-local-newspapers I mentioned a while back.  I've actually "started":http://twitter.com/chrisroos/statuses/570937102 to get some content up on "the-local-paper.co.uk":http://the-local-paper.co.uk if you want to play along and see how it's shaping up..
