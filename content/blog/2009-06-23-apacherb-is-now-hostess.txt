A little while ago I wrote about a utility called [apacherb](/blog/2008-12-15-a-utility-to-manage-apache-virtual-hosts-on-a-mac-like-the-passenger-pref-pane-but-for-simple-static-sites). It took the concept of the [passenger preference pane](http://www.fngtps.com/2008/06/putting-the-pane-back-into-deployment) and applied it to any local directory (rather than specifically rails apps). I'd always meant to turn the utility into a [gem](http://rubygems.org/) but never quite got round to it. Luckily, [James Adam](http://interblah.net/) moved the code to [github](http://github.com/lazyatom/hostess/tree/master), tidied it a little (notably making it restart apache after a change), renamed it and gemifimibulated it.

Install it with:

    $ gem install hostess

Executing it without any arguments will display some simple instructions.

    $ hostess
      Usage:
        hostess create domain directory - create a new virtual host
        hostess delete domain           - delete a virtual host
        hostess list                    - list hostess virtual hosts
        hostess help                    - this info

You'll need to run it as [sudo](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sudo) as it writes the configuration into /etc/apache2 and restarts apache.

To create a domain pointing at a local directory, you'd do something like:

    $ sudo hostess create example.local ~/Sites/example.local/

This will register the local domain (the .local suffix is a convention rather than a rule) using [directory services](http://developer.apple.com/opensource/dirservices/) and add the [apache](http://httpd.apache.org/) [virtual host](http://httpd.apache.org/docs/1.3/vhosts/). Open your browser and visit example.local to see your local site. Good huh.
