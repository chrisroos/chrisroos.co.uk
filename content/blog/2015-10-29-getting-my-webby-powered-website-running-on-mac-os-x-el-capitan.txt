This is what I needed to do to get [Webby](https://github.com/TwP/webby) powered [website](https://github.com/chrisroos/chrisroos.co.uk) working on my laptop.

    $ cd ~/Code/github/chrisroos.co.uk

    $ cat .rbenv-version
    1.8.7-p352

    $ rbenv install 1.8.7-p352

    ERROR: This package must be compiled with GCC, but ruby-build couldn't
    find a suitable `gcc` executable on your system. Please install GCC
    and try again.

    DETAILS: Apple no longer includes the official GCC compiler with Xcode
    as of version 4.2. Instead, the `gcc` executable is a symlink to
    `llvm-gcc`, a modified version of GCC which outputs LLVM bytecode.

    For most programs the `llvm-gcc` compiler works fine. However,
    versions of Ruby older than 1.9.3-p125 are incompatible with
    `llvm-gcc`. To build older versions of Ruby you must have the official
    GCC compiler installed on your system.

    TO FIX THE PROBLEM: Install Homebrew's apple-gcc42 package with this
    command: brew tap homebrew/dupes ; brew install apple-gcc42

    You will need to install the official GCC compiler to build older
    versions of Ruby even if you have installed Apple's Command Line Tools
    for Xcode package. The Command Line Tools for Xcode package only
    includes `llvm-gcc`.

    This formula provides components that were removed from XCode in the 4.2
    release. There is no reason to install this formula if you are using a
    version of XCode prior to 4.2.

    This formula contains compilers built from Apple's GCC sources, build
    5666.3, available from:

      http://opensource.apple.com/tarballs/gcc

    All compilers have a `-4.2` suffix. A GFortran compiler is also included.
