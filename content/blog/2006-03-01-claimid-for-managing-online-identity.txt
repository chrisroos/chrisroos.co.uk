I started reading about "claim id":http://claimid.com about a week ago, just as they were talking about launching a public beta.

As soon as the beta was launched I signed up and added "some links":http://claimid.com/chrisjroos to content about/by me on the web.

I like the approach they take; very simply grouping links based on their meaning to you.

One of the things we want for "reevoo":http://www.reevoo.com is the concept of 'my reviews'.  My personal preference has been to utilise one of many "existing":http://www.sixapart.com/typekey/index "authentication":http://openid.net/ services; but something has changed in my mind since seeing claimid: sadly I can't quite put my finger on it at present.
