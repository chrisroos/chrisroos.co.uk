I've recently upgraded the version of ruby on my machine and came up against problems similar to "this":/blog/2006-07-28-textmate-and-env-ruby-no-such-file-or-directory.  The problem previously was that "textmate":http://www.macromates.com wasn't finding "ruby":http://www.ruby-lang.org at all.  This time, textmate was finding the wrong version of ruby.

I found the following script useful in determining exactly which ruby binary textmate was using.

<pre><code>#!/usr/bin/env ruby

require 'rbconfig'
puts Config::CONFIG['bindir']</code></pre>

Simply paste that into a textmate document, select it and hit Ctrl-r.  The path of the ruby binary should print right there in the window.

To see far more info than you'll ever likely need, replace the line starting <code>puts</code> above, with the following..

<pre><code>Config::CONFIG.sort.each do |key, value|
  puts "\#{key} = \#{value}"
end</code></pre>
