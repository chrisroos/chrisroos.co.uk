  I noticed a little while ago that opening a, "Google Groups":http://groups.google.com hosted, file in "Safari":http://www.apple.com/safari/ didn't work.  I have a file at "http://delicious-trackbacks.googlegroups.com/web/installation.html":http://delicious-trackbacks.googlegroups.com/web/installation.html that you can try out if you're so inclined.  Requests for that file result in a page being rendered in Firefox but not in Safari or Internet Explorer (6 at least).  "James":http://interblah.net/ noticed that requests for these hosted files were resulting in a 302 response, as we can see from this "curl":http://curl.haxx.se/ output.

  <pre class="code shell">
  curl "http://delicious-trackbacks.googlegroups.com/web/installation.html" -v -X"HEAD"

  < HTTP/1.1 302 Moved Temporarily
  < Content-Type: text/html; charset=UTF-8
  < Content-Length: 0
  < Cache-control: private
  < Server: GFE/1.3

  </pre>

  The response also includes a body that contains a link to the actual file you want with some kind of key in the querystring.  Interestingly the response doesn't return a Location header.

  The "HTTP specification":http://www.w3.org/Protocols/rfc2616/rfc2616-sec10.html#sec10.3.3 states the following:

  bq. The temporary URI SHOULD be given by the Location field in the response. Unless the request method was HEAD, the entity of the response SHOULD contain a short hypertext note with a hyperlink to the new URI(s).

  So, it looks like Google are sending a valid response according to the spec (although I'm not sure whether they're intentionally leaving the Location header out) but that Safari and Internet Explorer are unable to deal with it.

  I found an existing report of "the bug":http://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=15822 over at the "webkit":http://webkit.org/ "bug tracker":http://bugs.webkit.org/ and added this information to it.  I also sent a "message":http://groups.google.com/group/Is-Something-Broken/browse_thread/thread/9e9a51c2b6841c8f/28088b462550858e#28088b462550858e to the "Google Groups: Is Something Broken":http://groups.google.com/group/Google-Groups-Guide group.
