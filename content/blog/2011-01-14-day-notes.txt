  I transcribed the [You and Yours](http://www.bbc.co.uk/radio4/features/you-and-yours/) [segment on National Rail Enquiries](http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/p00d4n2l) from the 6th Jan 2011.  I'm interested in National Rail's approach to third parties using their data (I was asked to [turn off a twitter bot](http://chrisroos.co.uk/blog/2009-01-31-turning-off-my-national-rail-twitter-bot) I wrote) and wanted the content of this interview to stick around even if/when the audio disapears.  I was genuinely surprised by how time consuming this was: It took the best part of three hours to transcribe this nine and half minute clip, comprised of a first pass (much pausing, playing and rewinding) to grab most of the content and multiple post passes to check the transcription and timestamps.

  I have some thoughts about the National Rail approach but will write them up separately.

  I got a reply from You and Yours about transcripts.

  > Many thanks for you query:  I'm afraid we don't have the resources to transcribe every "You and Yours" item (only items relating to disability), which is why the programmes are available on-line, and are now divided into 'chapters' to make it easier to find the bit you want.

  It turns out that this is stated on the [You and Yours Programmes page](http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b006qps9) but not on the transcripts page itself.
