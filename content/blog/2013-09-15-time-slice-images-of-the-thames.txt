  This image was created by taking 24 images (well, I think it might actually be 23 because my maths was off) from the set I captured on the [30th August 2013](http://thames-time-lapse.herokuapp.com/2013-08-30).

  I played around with different numbers of images making up the final image, but felt that one per hour produces the best results.

  I've also had a bit of a play with creating a movie from a set of 27 of these time-slice images. I really like the undulating effect of the water. You can also view it on [Vimeo](https://vimeo.com/74574559) if you can't see the video below.
