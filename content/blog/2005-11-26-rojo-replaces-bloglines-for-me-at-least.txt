Well, having used [bloglines](http://www.bloglines.com) [since](/blog/2005-10-02-online-news-reader) the beginning of October, I've just replaced it with [rojo](http://www.rojo.com). There were a couple of anoyances with bloglines - the main one being that if you click on a folder, all stories are marked as read. I realise that you can go through and keep them unread but if you click on a folder that contains [digg](http://www.digg.com) and [slashdot](http://www.slashdot.com), that's a lot of clicking when you might not have time right now.

The main reason for switching to rojo is that it [works as I would expect it to work](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Principle_of_least_surprise), particularly regarding the way in which stories are marked as read. It also seems to offer lots of cool tagging/social features that I'm yet to explore.
