[Jase](http://jasoncale.com/), [Tom](http://tomafro.net/), [Kalv](http://kalv.co.uk/) and I spent a chunk of the day at the new [O2](http://www.o2.co.uk/) offices in Slough.  We're going to spend at least a day a week there in future but this was more of a New Year catchup.  We got confirmation on a couple of dates and heard about some of the newer ideas O2 have got for [hashblue](https://hashblue.com/).

The downside of the meeting was that I had to endure some rush hour train and tubeage.  Nasty.
