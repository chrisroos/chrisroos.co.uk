OK, so I was made redundant from [reevoo](http://www.reevoo.com) just over a week ago and my initial holiday mood is now wearing off. I have a couple of things to follow up but I definitely don't have anything concrete so I'm putting this out there on the off chance someone wants to employ me (permanent or contract).

This is a direct copy of an email I sent someone when they requested a CV. It's not very comprehensive but it hopefully gives some indication of what I'm able to do.

Employment
----------

I spent just over three years at [reevoo.com](http://www.reevoo.com), until being made redundant on Monday 8th Dec 2008.

Skills
------

-   [Ruby](http://www.ruby-lang.org/en/). A splendid little language.
-   [Rails](http://www.rubyonrails.org/). Although I started using Rails in August 2005, I've definitely missed out on some of the more recent changes.
-   [Javascript](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JavaScript). Should only be used to enhance existing functionality and should (probably) never be *required* for a site.
-   [Testing](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software_testing). I'm completely sold on testing at all levels ([test/unit](http://www.ruby-doc.org/stdlib/libdoc/test/unit/rdoc/) up to [selenium](http://seleniumhq.org/), or an equivalent).
-   [CSS](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cascading_Style_Sheets). I'm not brilliant with CSS and although I can get reasonable results it'll take me longer than it would someone that really knows their stuff.
-   [HTML](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTML). I love clean and semantically marked up HTML.
-   [Pair Programming](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pair_programming). I prefer to pair program, particularly on production code.

Desired workplace
-----------------

-   I want to work with smart people.
-   I want to work on software that has a purpose I believe in.
-   I want to work somewhere that I'm able to question decisions and have my questions listened to.
-   I want to work with open source software.
-   I want to contribute back to the open source community.

Likes
-----

-   Simple solutions ([apache](http://httpd.apache.org/) and [webby](http://webby.rubyforge.org/) over a rails app, for example).
-   Learning and sharing knowledge.
-   Prioritising by always working on the next most important thing
-   Helping people through technology
-   The disruptive nature of technology

Dislikes
--------

-   [SEO](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Search_engine_optimization). In my opinion, it's as simple as doing the right thing (follow web standards, provide something useful and think about the user).
-   Websites that don't get the web ([activeplaces.com](http://activeplaces.com), [nationalrail.co.uk](http://nationalrail.co.uk))
-   Websites that are poorly marked up, therefore making scraping them hard :-) (particularly bank websites)
