Hmm.  I need to remove this, very firmly attached, processor from the heatsink and fan assembly.

I'm sure if I just apply a little pressure[1]...

Bugger.

In an effort to take something positive from the experience, I've created a "photoset":http://flickr.com/photos/chrisjroos/sets/72157594571965120/ on "flickr":http://www.flickr.com that describes the re-assembly process of the Sony Vaio K315B.

fn1.  More like a combination of pressure (on the processor, not me), lessening patience and a knife (resulting in two cut fingers.)  Ho hum.
