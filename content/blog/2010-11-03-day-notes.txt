  O2 meeting followed by a lunchtime discussion about [Go Free Range](http://gofreerange.com/) at the incredible [Windsor Castle](http://www.beerintheevening.com/pubs/s/87/873/Windsor_Castle/Marylebone) (home of the [handlebar club](http://www.handlebarclub.co.uk/meetings.shtml)).

  Pretty much finished up the 'project for upcoming conference' work with [James A](http://interblah.net/) and [Jase](http://jasoncale.com/).
