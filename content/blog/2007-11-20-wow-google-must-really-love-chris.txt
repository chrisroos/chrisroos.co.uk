I'd read "previously":http://www.scripting.com/stories/2007/07/17/instantIndexing.html about "Google":http://www.google.com indexing pages in almost real-time.  I only experienced it myself for the first time this evening.  I was continuing to search for answers to my "recent question":/blog/2007-11-20-can-anyone-recommend-a-good-simple-web-hosting-solution when my own question popped up at number three in the "search results":http://www.google.co.uk/search?hl=en&q=static+simple+web+hosting.

I assume this might be to do with Google's "Universal Search":http://googlewebmastercentral.blogspot.com/2007/05/taking-advantage-of-universal-search.html that blends lots of different sources into their main search results.  Or, they really do just love me.
