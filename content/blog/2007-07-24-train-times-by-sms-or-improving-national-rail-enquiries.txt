div(notice). This service is no longer running.  Please see "this post":/blog/2009-01-31-turning-off-my-national-rail-twitter-bot if you're interested to find out why.

I was in need of finding some train times at the weekend.  I usually use the "national rail enquiries":http://www.nationalrail.co.uk website but was without Internet access at the time.  Instead, I found myself waiting for about 10 minutes in a telephone queue just to spend about 30 seconds getting the information I was after.  This played on my mind a bit so last night I started "playing around":http://twitter.com/chrisroos/statuses/164273922 with automating the national rail timetable search.  That was relatively painless so I moved on to integrating with "twitter":http://www.twitter.com in order to provide an SMS interface to the service.  Within a couple of hours I had a twitterbot that receives timetable requests, looks up the times and sends them back to you.

It's actually currently all up and running.  Just follow "natrailenq":http://twitter.com/natrailenq on twitter and I'll follow you right back[1] (this seems to be necessary in order to send direct messages between each other).  A timetable request must be of the format 'origin_station (3 letter short code) destination_station (3 letter short code) depart_date (dd-mmmm) depart_time (hh:mm)'.  So, if we wanted to get times of trains from London Victoria (VIC) to Clapham Junction (CLJ) tomorrow midday, we'd send a message like so:

<pre class="code">
d natrailenq vic clj 25-july 12:00
</pre>

In this instance, we get the following response back.

<pre class="code">
natrailenq  11:55->12:02, 12:02->12:07, 12:03->12:09, 12:05->12:11, 12:06->12:11
</pre>

Cool huh.

The code is *nasty*.  You can see just how nasty it in the "repository":http://chrisroos.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/nat-rail-enq/.  It feels as though this could go somewhere - unless I'm violating some terms and conditions that I haven't read...  I make no guarantees as to how long the service will stay live, and I will certainly (probably) remove it if asked to.

fn1. Well, just as soon as I can at least - it's not automated at the moment.
