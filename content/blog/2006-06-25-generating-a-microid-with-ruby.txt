Very naive Ruby method to create a [MicroId](http://www.microid.org) for a given email and url.

    require 'digest/sha1'

    def micro_id(email, url)
      email_digest = Digest::SHA1.new(email).to_s
      url_digest = Digest::SHA1.new(url).to_s
      Digest::SHA1.new(email_digest + url_digest).to_s
    end

Note that there is no validation of the MicroId in this code at all.
