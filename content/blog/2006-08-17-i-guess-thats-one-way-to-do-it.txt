We're not _quite_ at this stage yet...

<pre>
class ActiveRecord::ConnectionAdapters::MysqlAdapter
  alias :execute_before_test_hijack :execute
  def execute(*args)
    unless args.first =~ /^SHOW FIELDS FROM/ || %w[BEGIN COMMIT ROLLBACK END].include?(args.first)
      raise "You know you're not allowed to use the database in your tests..." # We could be more gentle with a warn
    end
    execute_before_unit_test_hijack(*args)
  end
end
</pre>
