  Bought and watched the incredible [First Ascent series](http://www.firstascentseries.com/).  All six episodes contain inspirational stories and amazing footage.
  
  I ordered a [50t chainring](http://www.chainreactioncycles.com/Models.aspx?ModelID=47443) to pop on my new bike.  I'm slightly concerned that this'll make it a bit too hard to ride but I'll just have to wait to find out.
