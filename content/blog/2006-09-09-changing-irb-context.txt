I picked up on this yesterday and now cannot find the article (it was something to do with manipulating a rails app from the console).  Sorry.

<pre><code>irb(main):001:0> class Foo
irb(main):002:1> private
irb(main):003:1> def bar
irb(main):004:2> 'bar'
irb(main):005:2> end
irb(main):006:1> end
=> nil
irb(main):007:0> Foo.new.bar
NoMethodError: private method `bar' called for #<Foo:0x358304>
        from (irb):7
        from :0
irb(main):009:0> irb Foo.new # IMPORTANT BIT
irb#1(#<Foo:0x31c5fc>):001:0> bar
=> "bar"</code></pre>

Although cool, I can't think of any situations where this would have been useful.  Ho hum.
