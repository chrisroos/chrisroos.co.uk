  We had a general company chat about an internal messaging app we've been developing (a chat frontend of which is available as [Teamstream](https://github.com/freerange/teamstream)).

  We managed to get [Tom's](http://tomafro.net/) mobile number re-provisioned through the new mechanism that'll hopefully support us re-enabling the existing [#blue](https://hashblue.com/) functionality that was removed at Christmas and allow us to sign up many more customers.
