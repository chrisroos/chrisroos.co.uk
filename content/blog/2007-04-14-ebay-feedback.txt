This is a pathetic moan about something that is really not important at all.

I bought an [Apple mini DVI to VGA adapter](http://cgi.ebay.co.uk/ws/eBayISAPI.dll?ViewItem&ih=014&sspagename=STRK%3AMEWN%3AIT&viewitem=&item=330105019114&rd=1&rd=1) from someone on [ebay](http://www.ebay.co.uk). For various reasons, I was unable to test the adapter until yesterday (Fri 13th Apr), two weeks after the purchase. That didn't stop the seller emailing me a week ago, suggesting that I leave feedback before they do. That's pathetic - feedback should be left for me based on the speed of my purchase alone, which was immediate. What the seller is actually saying in that email is that if I decide to leave them bad feedback then they'll probably do the same to me out of retaliation. Grow up eh.

The adapter actually works great, and I've now left the seller positive feedback.
