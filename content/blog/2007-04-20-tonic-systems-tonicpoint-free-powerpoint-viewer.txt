I had need to view a powerpoint presentation on my Mac.  In the past, I've uploaded them to "slideshare":http://www.slideshare.net, but that wasn't suitable in this instance.  A quick google reveals some free java software by tonic systems.  Unfortunately (well, fortunately for tonic systems), they've been "bought":http://www.tonicsystems.com/ by google and the link to their software has disappeared.  Luckily, the google cache has a copy of the "original page":http://www.google.co.uk/search?q=cache:4BswR-sgicYJ:www.tonicsystems.com/products/viewer/+tonicsystems+java+viewer&hl=en&ct=clnk&cd=1&gl=uk with a "working link":http://downloads.tonicsystems.com/viewer/TonicPointViewer-1.4-OSX.zip to the download.

This probably won't remain relevant very long, what with the recent "news":http://www.techcrunch.com/2007/04/17/googles-office-suite-complete-google-powerpoint-confirmed/ of google adding a powerpoint clone to their office suite.
