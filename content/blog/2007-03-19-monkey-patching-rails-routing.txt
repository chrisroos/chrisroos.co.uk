This "plugin":http://chrisroos.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/plugins/routing_redirection/ offers the following two features.

# Permanently redirecting requests for urls that end in a slash to the equivalent url with no slash, helping disambiguate urls, as "explained":http://simonwillison.net/2007/Feb/4/urls/ by "Simon Willison":http://simonwillison.net/.
# The addition of ActionController::Routing::RouteSet::Mapper#permanently_redirect, allowing us to declare permanent redirections within our "route config":http://api.rubyonrails.com/classes/ActionController/Routing.html.

<pre><code>
ActionController::Routing:Routes.draw do |map|
  map.permanently_redirect 'legacy/view/:id', :controller => 'current', :action => 'show'
end
</code></pre>

A quick "google":http://www.google.co.uk/search?hl=en&q=rails+disambiguated+urls&btnG=Search reveals that "Rob McKinnon":http://fleetingideas.com/ has an "alternative suggestion":http://fleetingideas.com/2007/2/6/disambiguated-urls-with-ruby-on-rails for removing the trailing slashes.

The plugin is known to work with Rails 1.1.6.
