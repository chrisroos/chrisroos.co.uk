I have three minor outstanding issues with a recent sky installation. Not wanting to phone them (as previous experience suggests that it's going to waste a lot of my life) I thought I'd drop them an email.

Uh oh. Looks like they don't want my email.

So now, not only have I wasted time waiting for their website to time out while signing up, but I've also wasted time filling in a useless feedback form, taking a screenshot and even blogging about it. Oh, and I'm still going to have to speak to someone. Brilliant.
