  I just spent a few minutes installing "collaboa":http://www.collaboa.org on my "FreeBsd":http://www.freebsd.org server.

  I already had a number of the pre-requisites installed.  All that was outstanding was "swig":http://www.swig.org, the "subversion-ruby bindings":http://www.freshports.org/devel/subversion-ruby/ and the "ruby iconv bindings":http://www.freshports.org/converters/ruby-iconv/ which were all installed using packages.

  Collaboa is a "rails":http://www.rubyonrails.org alternative to "trac":http://www.edgewall.com/trac/, minus the wiki.  It basically provides a nice frontend to subversion and some project management'y type stuff.  I'm using it to host my "poor attempts":http://dev.seagul.co.uk at coding.
