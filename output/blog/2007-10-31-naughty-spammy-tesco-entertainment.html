      <h1>Naughty spammy Tesco Entertainment</h1>
      <p>Are Tesco Entertainment the new <a href="/blog/2007-03-16-orange-orange-orange?">Orange</a> They might just be you know. See, I’ve been sad and pathetic enough to <a href="http://chrisjroos.stikipad.com/unsubscriptions">record</a> details of unwanted emails that I receive. So far <a href="http://chrisjroos.stikipad.com/unsubscriptions/show/tesco-entertainment">Tesco Entertainment</a>, bless ‘em, have been unable to remove me from their mailing list for 90 days. I thought I’d write them a little email to, you know, ask them to stop spamming me.</p>
      <blockquote>
        <p>Here’s a list of emails you’ve sent me.</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Received: 26-Jun-2007</li>
          <li>Received: 11-Jul-2007</li>
          <li>Received: 27-Jul-2007</li>
          <li><strong>Unsubscribed</strong>: 30-Jul-2007 (although it appeared that I wasn’t actually signed up to any offers…)</li>
          <li>Received: 08-Aug-2007</li>
          <li>Received: 21-Aug-2007</li>
          <li>Received: 16-Oct-2007</li>
          <li>I emailed you on 17th Oct: “I unsubscribed from you guys on the 30th July 2007 (interestingly, my preferences suggested that I wasn’t actually subscribed to any mailings in the first place). Since then, you’ve sent me Tesco Entertainment emails on the 8th Aug, 21st Aug and 16th Oct1. Please stop. Cheers, Chris [1] http://chrisjroos.stikipad.com/unsubscriptions/show/tesco-entertainment”</li>
          <li>Received: 30-Oct-2007</li>
        </ul>
        <p>You’ll notice that I’ve received four emails since unsubscribing on the 30th July. I think three months is long enough to &gt; remove someone from your spam list isn’t it? Oh, and you’ll also see I’ve emailed you in the past too. It wouldn’t hurt to &gt; reply would it?</p>
        <p>Cheers,</p>
        <p>Chris</p>

      <p><strong>Update Thu 15th Nov 2007</strong></p>
      <p>I received a reply from Tesco.</p>
      <blockquote>
        <p>Thank you for your email.</p>
        <p>I’m sorry that you’ve received some unwanted emails.</p>
        <p>I’ve made arrangements to remove your email address chris@seagul.co.uk from our database. This process takes about 14 days and during this period you could still get emails from us.</p>
        <p>If you have any other email addresses registered, please let us know and we can remove these also.</p>
        <p>Thank you for telling us about this and giving us the chance to put things right.</p>
        <p>If you have any further queries please do not hesitate to contact us at customer.service@tesco.co.uk quoting TES4278070X.</p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>This phrase made me smile, “Thank you for telling us about this and giving us the chance to put things right.”.</p>
