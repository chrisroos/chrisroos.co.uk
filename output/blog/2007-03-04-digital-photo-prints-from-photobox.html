      <h1>Digital Photo Prints from PhotoBox</h1>
      <p>I just wanted to write a short note to recommend <a href="http://www.photobox.co.uk">PhotoBox</a>. I’ve been meaning to get some of my <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/chrisjroos">photos</a> printed for a while, but was put off by having to pay for a service that I knew nothing about. A short while ago, a friend <a href="http://ademblog.blogspot.com/2007/02/is-that-where-it-ends-with-your-life.html">mentioned</a> photobox. Not only do I trust Adem’s opinion, but photobox were (and still are, having just checked their homepage) offering 30 free prints when you sign-up. I signed up at around midday on Friday (23rd Feb 2007), selected 30 photos that I’d like printed, and uploaded them to photobox. I paid my £1.50 postage and duly received my confirmation email at 16:27 that day. The best thing was that 56 minutes later (17:23) I received an email to say that the photos had been dispatched. That’s pretty cool. They were sent First Class with <a href="http://www.royalmail.co.uk">Royal Mail</a> and I received them the next morning.</p>
      <p>I know that Adem has already used their service again, and I can only imagine that I will too. Would I have used them without Adem’s advocacy? Probably if they had the free offer (I’d have nothing to lose after all), almost certainly not if they didn’t.</p>
      <p>After all that praise, I’d like to suggest a couple of improvements.</p>
      <ol>
        <li>I already have all of my photos on <a href="http://www.flickr.com">flickr</a>. I should have been able to supply photobox with the location of these photos rather than having to painstakingly download and re-upload.
        </li>
        <li>I found the interface a little clumsy. At the checkout, it looked like some of my photos were going to be cropped, even though I didn’t ask for it, or see why they would be (they were ‘photo-size’ already.) This resulted in a bit of back and forth, on my part, through the interface, to ensure I hadn’t selected some option by mistake (I hadn’t and my photos weren’t cropped.) I feel that it could be made easier for the ‘just upload and print’ crowd.</li>
      </ol>
