      <h1>Reevoo.com dips its toes into the opensearch water</h1>
      <p>So. What does that mean exactly? Well, right at the moment, not a great deal. It pretty much means that you can add the ability to search reevoo.com to the Firefox 2 and IE7 browsers very easily. Visiting <a href="http://www.reevoo.com">reevoo.com</a> with either of these browsers will highlight part of the ‘search box’.</p>
      <p><img alt="" src="http://static.flickr.com/126/321626445_dfe00b4e0e.jpg?v=0"></p>
      <p>IE 7 changes the little arrow to a goldy, orangey, yellowy type colour to indicate the presence of an opensearch enabled search engine.</p>

      <p>While Firefox 2 opts for a blue surround and additionally chooses to add our logo. Woot.</p>
      <h2>I appreciate that I can now easily search reevoo from anywhere but was it really worth a blog post?</h2>
      <p>Hmm, interesting question (that wasn’t an actual question, I just made it up).</p>
      <p>Actually, I think that <a href="http://www.opensearch.org">opensearch</a> is pretty cool. At the moment, we are just exposing our search results in their html form. Just imagine, for a second, that we were instead, exposing our results as <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atom_%28standard%29">atom</a> or <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RSS_%28file_format%29">rss</a> feeds. Now, also imagine<sup class="footnote" id="fnr1"><a href="#fn1">1</a></sup> that retailers felt like being a little more open; and, as such, were offering an opensearch description of their search capabilities, along with search results in atom or rss feeds. All we’d need then was an <a href="http://a9.com">aggregator</a> that would allow us to search for products across our chosen retailers and reevoo in one go. The result would be a page containing both product reviews and pricing and stock availability from each retailer. That, I think, would be pretty damn cool.</p>
      <p class="footnote" id="fn1"><a href="#fnr1"><sup>1</sup></a> Currently, this requires a lot of imagination. A quick browse this afternoon found four big retailers that don't even have working search without javascript enabled. At least they've got <a href="http://www.w3.org/Provider/Style/URI">well</a> <a href="http://wiki.welldesignedurls.org/Main_Page">designed</a> urls. Oh, hang on...</p>
