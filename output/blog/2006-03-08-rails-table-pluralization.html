        <h1>Rails table pluralization</h1>
        <p>I was talking to someone recently about the pluralisation of table names in <a href="http://www.rubyonrails.org">rails</a>.  It was grating him because some hand built queries no longer read very naturally.</p>
        <pre class="code sql">&#x000A;-- (in rails) requesting the forename of the 'first' person&#x000A;SELECT forename FROM people WHERE people.id = 1;&#x000A;&#x000A;-- would read better as&#x000A;SELECT forename FROM person WHERE person.id = 1;</pre>
        <p><a href="http://po-ru.com/">Paul</a> (a colleague at <a href="http://www.reevoo.com">reevoo</a>) pointed out that there are two sides to the singular/plural table name debate.  You will always have some queries (as above) that will work better when the table is singular; and others (as below) that will work better when the table is plural.</p>
        <pre class="code sql">&#x000A;-- requesting all people having a country of 'uk'&#x000A;SELECT * FROM person WHERE country = 'UK';&#x000A;&#x000A;-- (in rails) would read better as&#x000A;SELECT * FROM people WHERE country = 'UK';</pre>
        <p>Personally, because of the very small amount of hand written sql I&#8217;ve had to use with Rails this has never been an issue to me.  However, it did make me think about a slight adaptation to Active Record&#8230;</p>
        <p>By default (in Rails), you create a singular (active record) model (person) that maps to the plural table (people).  Although very convenient (it&#8217;s the reason I&#8217;ve rarely had to touch sql), it too suffers from the same problems outlined in the queries above.  I think the two statements below show the same sort of natural vs unnatural language that appears in the sql above.</p>
        <pre class="code ruby">&#x000A;# good english (acting on a single person)&#x000A;Person.name = 'chris'&#x000A;Person.save&#x000A;&#x000A;# bad english (we are asking for multiple people)&#x000A;Person.find(:all, :conditions =&gt; "country = 'uk'")</pre>
        <p>The adaptation to active record I was thinking about would allow you to operate on both a Person and People, using the variant that made the code read more naturally.  That is, we could leave the Person.name example above as is, but change the Person.find to People.find<sup class="footnote" id="fnr1"><a href="#fn1">1</a></sup>.  There are different ways to go about this but to get some of the way there with a little code (i.e. not having to manually create both singular and plural classes for each table); I came up with the following simple hack.</p>
        <pre class="code ruby">&#x000A;class ActiveRecord::Base&#x000A;  class &lt;&lt; self&#x000A;    alias_method :__existing_inherited, :inherited&#x000A;    def inherited(child)&#x000A;      __existing_inherited(child)&#x000A;      plural_class = child.to_s.pluralize&#x000A;      unless plural_class =~ /#&lt;Class:./ or Object.constants.include?(plural_class)&#x000A;        Object.const_set(plural_class, Class.new(child))&#x000A;      end&#x000A;    end&#x000A;  end&#x000A;end</pre>
        <p>Just add it to the bottom of your environment.rb file and when you first reference one of your singular classes it will automatically descend a plural class from it.</p>
        <p>There are lots of things wrong with this code and many better ways for it to be implemented but it was really just for me to see if I could do it.</p>
        <p class="footnote" id="fn1"><a href="#fnr1"><sup>1</sup></a> Boring and sad.  I was going to start that sentence with i.e. but wasn&#8217;t sure whether that was grammatically correct (I&#8217;m not very good at English).  I did a quick search and found that it translates as &#8216;that is&#8217; from the Latin which is much better.</p>
