        <h1>Version Control Commit Note Best Practice (or not, you decide)</h1>
        <p>This is my own opinion but it has evolved from the need to dig back into past commit notes <strong>a lot</strong>.  The lazy approach to writing commit notes is just to explain what&#8217;s in the changeset (much like a code comment that says &#8220;set x to 1&#8221;):  It&#8217;s exactly what I used to write (and still do if I&#8217;m not concentrating).  The more useful approach is to explain why the changeset is there.  I can take two of my own commit notes as examples.</p>
        <h2>Useless commit note</h2>
        <blockquote>
        <p>Capistrano deploy:setup should generate apache proxy cluster configuration.</p>
        </blockquote>
        <p>This is a fairly useless commit note: If I was to come back to this (as I did today when looking at it) I would have no idea what I was trying to achieve.  Why should the config be generated at setup and not at some other point in the deploy process?  If I&#8217;d spent an extra 30 seconds writing the note in the first place I wouldn&#8217;t have to try to work out what I was trying to achieve.</p>
        <h2>More useful commit note</h2>
        <blockquote>
        <p>This isn't a card but _has_ been bugging me for a long time. You can now click on the <product_type> in the 'Top 3 <product_type>' headings on super category pages to visit that product type. Oh, I also made them h2s as having multiple h1s on a page just doesn't make sense.</p>
        </blockquote>
        <p>This is a much more useful (imho) comment.  If at some point in the future we want to know why the &#8216;top 3 product types&#8217; is now a link, we can come back to the note and see that it was because I, personally, was fed up of it not being so.  I also explain why I&#8217;ve changed the heading from a h1 to h2 (although that comment could be open to interpretation: why doesn&#8217;t it make sense?).</p>
        <p>This all ties into submitting small checkins that are only doing one thing, but I might try to give some examples of that separately.</p>
        <p>Anyone else have any thoughts or alternative approaches?</p>
