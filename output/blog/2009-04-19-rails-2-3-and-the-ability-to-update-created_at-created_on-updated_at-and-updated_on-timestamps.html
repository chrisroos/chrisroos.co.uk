      <h1>Rails 2.3 and the ability to update created_at, created_on, updated_at and updated_on timestamps</h1>
      <p>The timing of the <a href="http://groups.google.com/group/rubyonrails-security/browse_thread/thread/1d2fb5dc524f9ff4">automatically generated timestamps and attribute assignment in rails 2.3 security note</a> <sup class="footnote" id="fnr1"><a href="#fn1">1</a></sup> was interesting to me because I’d just spent a while really trying to get my head around <a href="http://api.rubyonrails.org/classes/ActiveRecord/Base.html#M002226">attr_accessible</a> and <a href="http://api.rubyonrails.org/classes/ActiveRecord/Base.html#M002225">attr_protected</a> and the best way to test their effects in an app I was working on. Although I intend to write about the testing separately, the conclusion I came to was that I wanted to test the behaviour (more specifically, I was interested in what I could/couldn’t assign) of my objects and not that I was specifically using attr_accessible or attr_protected.</p>
      <p>Reading Alex’s post made me wonder whether the <a href="http://rubyonrails.org/">rails</a> <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/API">API</a> ever guaranteed that the timestamps would be readonly: If that was the case then I can see arguments for not wanting to test the behaviour of your objects (because you’re essentially testing the framework itself). I couldn’t find any mention of whether they’d specifically be readonly so chose to do a bit of digging. I created a <a href="http://chrisroos.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/scratch/rails_timestamps_test/">script</a> that allowed me to, with relative ease, run tests against rails apps created with different versions of rails. Using this I was able to test the mass assignment of timestamps (created_at, created_on, updated_at and updated_on) against multiple versions of rails. The conclusion I came to (and I’d love for other people to replicate my experiment and prove/disprove my results) was that the created_at and created_on pair of attributes have always (at least as far back as rails 1.0.0) been assignable, while the updated_at and updated_on attributes have only recently become assignable. While digging I managed to find the <a href="https://rails.lighthouseapp.com/projects/8994/tickets/1612-cant-create-ar-models-with-custom-updated_xx-timestamp">lighthouse ticket</a> (#1612) that requested the ability to set the updated_* timestamps and the <a href="http://github.com/rails/rails/commit/63aac338332a06d3c9e28dde7954679703ec7620">rails commit</a> that closed that ticket.</p>

        <li>If you specify a tag of rails that is anything other than a 3 part version number (e.g. the four part version 2.3.2.1, or the release candidate 2.1.0_RC1) then the version test will fail because the Rails::VERSION constant only contains the MAJOR, MINOR and TINY components and that’s what we use to check the version our app uses.</li>

        <li>The supplied database.yml file assumes a mysql database running on localhost that has a root user with no password. You can update this to reflect your actual environment.</li>
      </ul>
      <ul>
        <li>The projects are created in /path/to/code/rails_timestamps_test/projects/ with a name like rails-app-x-x-x (major, minor, tiny).</li>
      </ul>
      <ul>
        <li>In order to ensure we are testing against the correct version of rails, I symlink rails from /path/to/code/rails (after changing to the requested tag) into rails-app-x-x-x/vendor/rails. The problem here is that if you re-run the script with a different rails version and then attempt to run a test from your first project that it will be using the recently specified version of rails. Luckily, the rails_version_test will fail fast which means you shouldn’t have to waste time wondering why something is not working as expected.</li>
      </ul>
      <ul>
        <li>I wonder whether it’d be useful to extract the ‘create a rails app from a specific version of rails’ functionality out of this script?</li>
