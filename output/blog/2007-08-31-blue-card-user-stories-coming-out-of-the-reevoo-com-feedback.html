      <h1>Blue card user stories coming out of the reevoo.com feedback</h1>
      <p>It took me a while, but I’ve come up with some <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User_story">stories</a> to represent the feature requests from the <a href="http://www.reevoo.com">reevoo.com</a> <a href="/blog/2007-08-23-responses-to-reevoo-com-feedback">feedback</a>.</p>
      <p>I (well <a href="http://www.po-ru.com">Paul</a> actually) even took a photo to prove it.</p>
      <p><a href="http://flickr.com/photos/chrisjroos/1284248507"><img alt="" src="http://farm2.static.flickr.com/1175/1284248507_c7d8653554_m.jpg"></a></p>
      <p>We have a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Extreme_Programming_Practices#Planning_game">planning game</a> next Tuesday (4th Sep) so we’ll have to wait to see if any of them get in.</p>
      <p>I’ve written the cards out in full below. If anyone recognises one of their requests and thinks I’ve misrepresented it then feel free to let me know.</p>
      <h2>Remove search filters</h2>
      <p>As a user of reevoo.com, I want to be able to remove filters in the same way that I can add them, so that I don’t have to start my search again if I want to change my search criteria.</p>
      <h2>Display scores of related products</h2>
      <p>As a user of reevoo.com, I want to see the scores of ‘related products’, so that I can instantly decide whether those products might be of interest to me.</p>
      <h2>Display usefulness of reviews</h2>
      <p>As a user of reevoo.com, I want to know how useful the reviews are, so that I can get a feel for the ‘importance’ of a review.</p>
      <h2>Favicon</h2>
      <p>As a user of reevoo.com, I want to immediately identify your favicon with reevoo branding, so that I can immediately pick it out in my search history and browser tabs.</p>
      <h2>Recently viewed products</h2>
      <p>As a user of reevoo.com, I want to see a list of my recently viewed products, so that I can easily find my way back to the products I’m interested in.</p>
      <h2>Scores obviously out of 10</h2>
      <p>As a user of reevoo.com, I want it to be obvious that the review scores are out of 10, so that I don’t waste time trying to work it out and can, instead, find the products that I’m interested in.</p>
      <h2>Product count on supercategory pages</h2>
      <p>As a user of reevoo.com, I always want to see the number of products appear next to the product category, so that I can easily scan down the list of categories.</p>
      <h2>General comments</h2>
      <p>As a user of reevoo.com, I want to be able to immediately identify that the general comments are indeed general comments, so that I don’t waste time trying to work out what they are and whether they’re important.</p>
