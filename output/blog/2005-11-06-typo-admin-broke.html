      <h1>Typo admin broke!</h1>
      <p>I went to add a link to my bloglines public feed this morning and couldn’t log into typo admin. I double checked that my username and password were correct using the console and so took a look at the accounts controller. Using some advanced debugging techniques (mmm render :text =&gt; ‘’) I found that request.method was returning :POST where the code was checking for :post. I amended the controller and all now works. I’m just really not sure why it stopped working as nothing had changed!</p>
      <p><strong>Update Sun 6th Nov 14:26</strong></p>
      <p>I originally tried to post this article yesterday but it would appear that the new method in the content controller was also broken - checking for request.post? was not working as expected. I’ve just changed this to request.method == :POST and it now works. Really not sure what’s going on though.</p>
      <p><strong>Update Sun 6th Nov 14:40</strong></p>
      <p>Right then, it would appear that the ‘method’ method of request had been changed from <code>env['REQUEST_METHOD'].downcase.to_sym</code> to <code>env['REQUEST_METHOD'].to_sym</code>. This was in actionpack 1.9.1. Checking the version on my laptop confirms that it should be the downcase variant. I’ve now changed it back so will see how it goes.</p>
      <p><strong>Update Mon 7th Nov 08:45</strong></p>
      <p>It would appear that it was actually me that changed the code in request.rb when I was trying to diagnose and fix some problems when installing <a href="http://weed.rbse.com">weed</a>. Oops.</p>
