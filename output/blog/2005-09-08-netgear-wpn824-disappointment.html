      <h1>Netgear WPN824 disappointment</h1>
      <p>I’ve installed a handful of wireless networks over the years and have always gone for <a href="http://www.netgear.co.uk">Netgear</a> products due to price and my perceived quality of the items.</p>
      <p>I recently had another wireless network to install which was to span a house and an office at the end of the garden. Having looked at the latest Netgear offerings I decided upon the <a href="http://netgear.co.uk/rangemax_wirelessrouter_wpn824.php">WPN824</a>. This was mainly due to the boasts of “Network range extended by up to 400 feet”. Although the item was slightly more expensive (£73.91 ex Vat at time of writing<sup class="footnote" id="fnr1"><a href="#fn1">1</a></sup>) than the alternatives, I was figuring on not having to buy additional antennae for the individual computers and therefore saving that way. The first problem I had was that I had mis-interpreted the device as an ADSL router rather than a Broadband router. Because of this oversight I had to purchase an additional ADSL Ethernet Modem (<a href="http://netgear.co.uk/wired_adsl_router_dg632.php">Netgear DG632</a>) for £36.45 ex Vat at the time of writing. This was already going over budget.</p>
      <p>On installation I was greeted with very dissapointing results. I was using <a href="http://netgear.co.uk/rangemax_wirelesspci_wpn311.php">Netgear WPN311</a> cards in each desktop and the wireless router was placed equidistant from each machine (albeit one had to travel through a couple of walls and the other through open air and wooden divides).</p>
      <p>I tried all of the channels, with and without encryption and selecting the network types (b, g, b & g, 108MB only), all to no avail. I was getting a signal but not one that was strong and consistent enough to work with.</p>
      <p>The money I thought I was saving by buying the more expensive router was about to disapear with the addition of a <a href="http://solwise.co.uk/wireless-indoorantenna-omni-105os.htm">5db omni-direction antennae</a> for each of the desktop machines.</p>
      <p>With the antennae added, wireless performance was ok, although only really when running at a max of 54Mbs (i.e. I was still not able to take advantage of the 108Mbs speeds).</p>
      <p>I still wasn’t amazingly happy with this performance and so obtained a <a href="http://netgear.co.uk/wireless_adslrouter_dg834g.php">Netgear DG834G</a> ADSL/Wireless router combo. This was installed in place of the WPN824/DG632 pair and to my slight surprise both faster network speeds and better consistency prevailed.</p>
      <p>I’m currently in the process of sending the WPN824/DG632 units back to eBuyer on the basis that they (well, the WPN824 at least) do not live up to their promises.</p>
      <p>As indicated at the top of the article, I’m generally pleased with Netgear products but have been let down by the exagerated promises of this particular device.</p>
      <p>Mini-disclaimer: This is based only on my experience with the product. Your experience may vary.</p>
