        <h1>'We will never ask for your security details...'</h1>
        <p>I saw <a href="http://simon.incutio.com/archive/2005/11/09/orange">this</a> recently and it reminded of a call I had a couple of months ago from <span class="caps">HSBC</span>.  The call came through on an 0845 number and the caller stated that he was from <span class="caps">HSBC</span> and needed some security details before he could talk to me.  I immediately assumed that this was a hoax and wouldn&#8217;t supply the details requested.  He didn&#8217;t actually ask for my password but did request post code, date of birth and mother&#8217;s maiden name.  I asked him what the call was concerning and he said that he couldn&#8217;t tell me before I answered his questions.  I said that I wouldn&#8217;t answer his questions and he started to &#8216;issue me a warning&#8217;.  I hung up.  I then immediately called <span class="caps">HSBC</span>, stating that I&#8217;d received this call and asking if they had any record of it.  The guy I spoke to this time said that it was very possible I&#8217;d been contacted as I&#8217;d gone way over my overdraft limit and there was a note on my account.  Oops.  It made me feel a bit bad for hanging up on the first guy but I&#8217;m still not convinced they should have called in the first place &#8211; a letter would be more appropriate in these days of such prevalent phishing and scamming.  Ho hum.</p>
