      <h1>I hope I didn't break rubyforge...</h1>
      <p>A couple of days ago I was playing around with <a href="http://search.cpan.org/~clkao/SVN-Mirror-0.68/lib/SVN/Mirror.pm">SVN::Mirror</a>, trying to remove some <a href="http://wiki.rubyonrails.org/rails/pages/Plugins">dependencies</a> on third party repositories not in our control.</p>
      <p>All was going well until I tried to mirror a <a href="http://rubyforge.org/projects/mocha/">project</a> hosted on rubyforge. On initialising the mirror, I kept receiving the error “source url not under source root” from line 72 in Ra.pm.</p>
      <p>After some very careful debugging (yeah, like I know anything about perl - <code>print "1";</code> was about the extent of it) of that perl file; I noticed that the <code>$source_root</code> variable didn’t contain the double slash<sup class="footnote" id="fnr1"><a href="#fn1">1</a></sup>. This causes a problem for the line <code>if substr($path, 0, length($source_root), '') ne $source_root;</code> as at this point, <code>$path</code> does contain the double slash.</p>
      <p>The value of <code>$source_root</code> is returned from a call to <code>RA-&gt;get_repos_root</code> (Subversion Repository Access code). So; it would seem that the url was being normalised somewhere in the bowels of <a href="http://subversion.tigris.org">Subversion</a>.</p>
      <p>This was kinda confirmed by testing the svn client (which uses the code in the RA module just like SVN::Mirror) with urls containing additional slashes. The url was always resolved and svn info would always show the normalised variant. It was additionally(ish) tested by using the <a href="http://www.ruby-lang.org">Ruby</a> <a href="http://svn.collab.net/viewvc/svn/trunk/subversion/bindings/swig/ruby/">bindings</a> (which, as an aside, contain just about the most difficult to read Ruby code I’ve ever come across!)</p>
      <p>I would love to have followed the actual subversion c code to find the normalisation routine but I’m sadly not clever enough; so my findings had to suffice.</p>
      <p>Anyhoo, the outcome of the story is that I emailed Tom Copeland of rubyforge fame to ask about the deal with the double slashes. Turns out that it was probably just a <a href="http://gforge.org/">gforge</a> default thing and Tom went ahead and promptly changed it. I suddenly got very nervous that lots of arms would be thrown up with cries of “Who broke rubyforge?”, but so far it would appears to be ok. Phew.</p>
      <p class="footnote" id="fn1"><a href="#fnr1"><sup>1</sup></a> Not sure if anyone else had really noticed but the svn repositories on rubyforge used to contain a double slash between the domain and var path (i.e. rubyforge.org//var).</p>
