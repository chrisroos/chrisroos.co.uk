      <h1>Bookmark printing service for the Go Free Range Printer platform</h1>
      <p>I’ve spent the last couple of days creating a simple service for the <a href="http://gofreerange.com/printer">Printer platform</a>. This service allows you to print a bookmark (in the traditional sense) for the book you’re reading. Although it’s probably of most use to those people with their own printers, you can definitely have a play with generating your own bookmarks (and see a printed example) over on the <a href="http://printer-bookmarks.heroku.com/">Printer bookmarks app on Heroku</a>.</p>
      <p>The idea of a book-specific bookmark, on which I can record when I start and finish along with some reading notes, appeals to me. I can actually imagine that a custom bookmark printing service like this might be useful outside of this little experiment with the Printer platform.</p>
      <p>Developing this little bookmark application (<a href="https://github.com/freerange/printer-bookmarks">source on github</a>) allowed me to use the Printer platform in anger, which was great as I’d only really been following <a href="http://gofreerange.com/james-adam">James A</a>’s impressive work from the sidelines.</p>
      <h2>Building the bookmark service</h2>
      <p>The rest of this post is a fairly high level view of how I approached the development of this little service. Hopefully I’ll convey how simple it is to build your own Printer service.</p>
      <p>I started by looking at the example <a href="https://github.com/freerange/printer-mail">Printer Mail</a>, <a href="https://github.com/freerange/printer-paint">Printer Paint</a> and <a href="https://github.com/freerange/printer-weather">Printer Weather</a> apps. While these services are geared toward sending content (from a person in the case of mail and paint, and from a machine in the case of weather) to another person’s printer, I think the bookmark service is most useful for someone wanting to print to their own printer. This made my life a little easier as it meant I didn’t need to worry about storing printer details in my app: I could rely on the user entering their printer address at the time they wanted to print the bookmark.</p>
      <p>The first thing I did was create a simple html bookmark (see <a href="https://github.com/freerange/printer-bookmarks/commit/7652ba185832ecf1e7e7bad44442d4292b5d5e1a">7652ba</a>) that I could preview using the <a href="https://github.com/freerange/printer/wiki/API">Printer API</a> (you can think of the Printer API as something like <a href="http://www.google.com/cloudprint/learn/">Google Cloud Print</a> for receipt printers). Once happy that the preview looked OK I moved on to making the bookmark dynamic based on a supplied Amazon URL (see <a href="https://github.com/freerange/printer-bookmarks/commit/3f5377c3b8809565ebb6cc26aad11075a073a625">3f5377</a>). The addition of some tests allowed me to refactor the code in preparation for the simple Sinatra web interface (see <a href="https://github.com/freerange/printer-bookmarks/commit/a75e4aa20a3eb3f3f90480636719443322841502">a75e4a</a>). Once able to view the bookmarks in a browser I wanted them to look a little closer to how they’d look once printed. Fortunately, I was able to borrow the template from the Printer Mail app to do just that (see <a href="https://github.com/freerange/printer-bookmarks/commit/0ba53664fc3cfa091567ef678cad0211811acb8e">0ba536</a>). I had the app deployed to <a href="http://www.heroku.com/">Heroku</a> by this time so I was “done” in the most simple of senses: I could use the publicly accessible bookmark preview (e.g. <a href="http://printer-bookmarks.heroku.com/bookmark?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.co.uk%2FThe-Vinci-Code-Dan-Brown%2Fdp%2F0552149519%2Fref%3Dsr_1_2%3Fie%3DUTF8%26qid%3D1334252406%26sr%3D8-2">bookmark for The Da Vinci Code</a>) to print to the <a href="http://printer.gofreerange.com/">Go Free Range Printer backend</a>. After that, apart from making it easier to print (see <a href="https://github.com/freerange/printer-bookmarks/commit/d84b751bda676fefceb286519cda31d6610b7e79">d84b75</a>) and preview (see <a href="https://github.com/freerange/printer-bookmarks/commit/617d24ff5d1ed2460b151aa09f4cbfa2f510015b">617d24</a>) bookmarks, the remainder of the changes were mainly aesthetic. Pretty simple, huh.</p>
