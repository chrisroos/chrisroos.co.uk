        <title>Confusing git log behaviour</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;I was confused by the behaviour of &lt;code&gt;git log&lt;/code&gt; when using the &lt;code&gt;before&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;after&lt;/code&gt; options. After some playing I realised that it was because the default &lt;code&gt;git log&lt;/code&gt; output shows the author date but the &lt;code&gt;before&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;after&lt;/code&gt; options operate on the &lt;code&gt;commit&lt;/code&gt; date.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I can demonstrate the behaviour in an empty repository.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Create a new git repo&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;$ cd /tmp
$ mkdir testing-git-log
$ cd testing-git-log
$ git init
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Create a file and add it to the repo&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;$ touch file1
$ git add file1
$ git commit -m &quot;Add file1&quot;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Edit the author and commit date of the commit&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;$ GIT_COMMITTER_DATE=&quot;2015-01-02 09:00&quot; \
git commit --amend \
--date &quot;2015-01-01 09:00&quot; \
--reuse-message HEAD
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The &lt;code&gt;--date&lt;/code&gt; option sets the author date of the commit.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Setting &lt;code&gt;GIT_COMMITTER_DATE&lt;/code&gt; affects the commit date of the commit when it‚Äôs amended.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Check that the author and commit date have been set as expected&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;$ git log --pretty=fuller
Author:     Chris Roos &amp;lt;chris@seagul.co.uk&amp;gt;
AuthorDate: Thu Jan 1 09:00:00 2015 +0000
Commit:     Chris Roos &amp;lt;chris@seagul.co.uk&amp;gt;
CommitDate: Fri Jan 2 09:00:00 2015 +0000

    Add file1
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Use git log to show commits on 1st Jan 2015&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;$ git log --after &quot;2015-01-01 00:00&quot; --before &quot;2015-01-01 23:59:59&quot;
# Nothing shown
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Use git log to show commits on 2nd Jan 2015&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;$ git log --after &quot;2015-01-02 00:00&quot; --before &quot;2015-01-02 23:59:59&quot;

    Add file1
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

        <title>Manually uploading activities from Garmin Fit app</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;I had two activities recorded on 12 Nov 2015 that weren‚Äôt syncing to Garmin Connect from the Garmin Fit app on my phone. I signed out and back in a number of times to try to force the sync (as per &lt;a href=&quot;https://support.garmin.com/support/searchSupport/case.faces?caseId=%7Ba3c0eb60-ff54-11e0-73d0-000000000000%7D&quot;&gt;Garmin‚Äôs support page&lt;/a&gt;), but to no avail.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I eventually used &lt;a href=&quot;https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.sand.airdroid&amp;amp;hl=en_GB&quot;&gt;Airdroid&lt;/a&gt; to download the two .fit files (stored in /SD Card/Android/data/com.garmin.android.apps.fitness/files/) from my phone to my laptop.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I was able to manually import those files into &lt;a href=&quot;https://connect.garmin.com&quot;&gt;Garmin Connect&lt;/a&gt; and can now see the two activities as expected.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After signing out and back in to the Garmin Fit app I noticed that the 2 activities on 12 Nov 2015 were now duplicated - presumably the versions on the phone were slightly different from the versions on the website. I fixed this by removing all the Garmin Fit app data from my phone and signing in one final time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Garmin Fit app has been removed&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While writing this I tried to find a link to the Garmin Fit app in the Google Play Store. While I can see it in my list of installed apps, it no longer appears in the public store. I also followed the link to the app in iTunes but that reports that it‚Äôs no longer available in the UK store. I can‚Äôt find any official information about the app being removed but &lt;a href=&quot;https://forums.garmin.com/showthread.php?314912-Is-Garmin-Fit-gone&quot;&gt;this thread on the Garmin forums suggests that it was removed in early 2015!&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Getting my Webby powered website running on Mac OS X El Capitan</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;This is what I needed to do to get &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/TwP/webby&quot;&gt;Webby&lt;/a&gt; powered &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/chrisroos/chrisroos.co.uk&quot;&gt;website&lt;/a&gt; working on my laptop.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;$ cd ~/Code/github/chrisroos.co.uk

$ cat .rbenv-version
1.8.7-p352

$ rbenv install 1.8.7-p352

ERROR: This package must be compiled with GCC, but ruby-build couldn&#39;t
find a suitable `gcc` executable on your system. Please install GCC
and try again.

DETAILS: Apple no longer includes the official GCC compiler with Xcode
as of version 4.2. Instead, the `gcc` executable is a symlink to
`llvm-gcc`, a modified version of GCC which outputs LLVM bytecode.

For most programs the `llvm-gcc` compiler works fine. However,
versions of Ruby older than 1.9.3-p125 are incompatible with
`llvm-gcc`. To build older versions of Ruby you must have the official
GCC compiler installed on your system.

TO FIX THE PROBLEM: Install Homebrew&#39;s apple-gcc42 package with this
command: brew tap homebrew/dupes ; brew install apple-gcc42

You will need to install the official GCC compiler to build older
versions of Ruby even if you have installed Apple&#39;s Command Line Tools
for Xcode package. The Command Line Tools for Xcode package only
includes `llvm-gcc`.

        <title>Exploring my Google Location History</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;I used &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.google.com/settings/takeout&quot;&gt;Google Takeout&lt;/a&gt; to export my &lt;a href=&quot;https://maps.google.co.uk/locationhistory/b/0&quot;&gt;Location History&lt;/a&gt; as JSON. I wanted to know what date range the file covered (it‚Äôs not obvious from the Location History site) and figured I‚Äôd use command line tools rather than parsing the JSON.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is the command I ended up with to display the earliest timestamp in the file:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;  $ cat LocationHistory.json | \
  grep timestampMs | \
  grep -o -E &quot;\d+&quot; | \
  sort | \
  head -n1 | \
  cut -c1-10 | \
  xargs -J% date -j -f &quot;%s&quot; %

  #=&amp;gt; Sun  4 Mar 2012 12:33:29 GMT
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;## Building the command&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Use &lt;code&gt;grep&lt;/code&gt; to extract all the lines containing timestamps.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;  $ head LocationHistory.json | \
  grep timestampMs

  #=&amp;gt; &quot;timestampMs&quot; : &quot;1414831041235&quot;,
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Use &lt;code&gt;grep&lt;/code&gt; to extract the timestamp from each line.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;  $ head LocationHistory.json | \
  grep timestampMs | \
  grep -o -E &quot;\d+&quot;              # Find 1 or more digits and print the matching string

  #=&amp;gt; 1414831041235
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Use &lt;code&gt;cut&lt;/code&gt; to strip off the milliseconds from the timestamp.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;  $ head LocationHistory.json | \
  grep timestampMs | \
  grep -o -E &quot;\d+&quot; | \
  cut -c1-10                    # Ignore the last three digits (milliseconds) of the timestamp

  #=&amp;gt; 1414831041
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Use &lt;code&gt;date&lt;/code&gt; to display the timestamp in a human friendly format.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;  $ head LocationHistory.json | \
  grep timestampMs | \
  grep -o -E &quot;\d+&quot; | \
  cut -c1-10 | \
  xargs -J% date -j -f &quot;%s&quot; %   # Use `-j` to avoid setting the date
                                # and -f &quot;%s&quot; to tell date to parse the string as unix time

  #=&amp;gt; Sat  1 Nov 2014 08:37:21 GMT
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The full command adds &lt;code&gt;sort&lt;/code&gt; to ensure all timestamps are ordered and then either &lt;code&gt;head -n1&lt;/code&gt; or &lt;code&gt;tail -n1&lt;/code&gt; to print the earliest and latest dates respectively.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Notes from The First International Conference on Software Archaeology</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://jamesmead.org/&quot;&gt;James&lt;/a&gt; and I attended &lt;a href=&quot;http://ticosa.org/&quot;&gt;The First International Conference on Software Archaeology&lt;/a&gt; last week.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I‚Äôve spent some time going through the notes I made and have categorised the things I took from the presentations into three broad themes. I‚Äôm not sure how effective a picture this paints for anyone that wasn‚Äôt there but hopefully there‚Äôs something useful in here. For an alternative overview, please see &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.fatvat.co.uk/2014/02/the-first-international-conference-on.html&quot;&gt;Jeff Foster‚Äôs TICOSA writeup&lt;/a&gt; or the &lt;a href=&quot;http://ticosa.org/sessions.html&quot;&gt;TICOSA sessions&lt;/a&gt; page which contains some of the presentation slides.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The three broad themes are analysing legacy code (the past), working on legacy code (the present) and helping our future selves (the future).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Analysing legacy code&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;I think the main thing I took away from this theme was that there‚Äôs quite a lot of work going into what still appears to be a fairly new idea.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/mfeathers&quot;&gt;Michael Feathers&lt;/a&gt; demonstrated the use of his &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/michaelfeathers/delta-flora&quot;&gt;delta-flora&lt;/a&gt; tool to analyse Ruby projects over the history of the git repository.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/dmitrykandalov&quot;&gt;Dmitry Kandalov&lt;/a&gt; demonstrated his &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/dkandalov/code-history-mining&quot;&gt;code-history-mining IntelliJ plugin&lt;/a&gt; that was inspired by Michael‚Äôs delta-flora.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/robsmallshire&quot;&gt;Robert Smallshire&lt;/a&gt; showed us a number of ways of visualising complexity, including maps of complexity density, and explained how we can use these to identify areas of concern in a system.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/stephaneducasse&quot;&gt;St√©phane Ducasse&lt;/a&gt; told us that having to maintain software means that the software is useful and successful. So, maintenance is a good thing but we can often benefit from dedicated tools that help us understand our specific problems.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Working on legacy code&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;The main thing I took away from this theme was the reinforcement of my belief that we shouldn‚Äôt be so quick to think that we can improve something by throwing it away and rewriting it.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Avoiding the temptation to throw away what‚Äôs there&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;St√©phane Ducasse reminded us that, ‚ÄúEarly decisions were certainly good at that time‚Äù&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/keithb_b&quot;&gt;Keith Braithwaite&lt;/a&gt; explained that different types of people approach problems in slightly different ways: Computer scientists might prefer a single longer method that contains all the logic, while OO advocates might prefer many smaller methods. There are merits to both approaches and we should remember that projects coded in a style different to our own aren‚Äôt wrong; they‚Äôre just different.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/chrisoldwood&quot;&gt;Chris Oldwood&lt;/a&gt;‚Äôs lightning talk &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/dmitrykandalov/status/429401314234494977&quot;&gt;contained a paraphrased quote&lt;/a&gt; (coined by either &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikiquote.org/wiki/Talk:Robert_Frost&quot;&gt;Robert Frost&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=&quot;http://platitudesundone.blogspot.co.uk/2010/04/dont-take-fence-down-until-you-know-why.html&quot;&gt;G.K. Chesterton&lt;/a&gt;) that really resonated with me:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Don‚Äôt ever take a fence down until you know why it was put up&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/stuartcurran&quot;&gt;Stuart Curran&lt;/a&gt; reminded us of George Santayana‚Äôs quote, ‚ÄúThose who cannot remember the past are condemned to repeat it‚Äù&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Using tools to get an overview of the code we‚Äôre working on&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Michael Feathers (using delta-flora), Dmitry Kandalov (using his IntelliJ plugin) and Robert Smallshire (in his dependency structure matrices) all demonstrated ways of visualising which parts of the system are tightly coupled.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Helping our future selves&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;The main thing I took away from this theme was that code will be around for longer than we expect and we should do our best to help our future selves.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;St√©phane Ducasse reminded us that software is a living entity and will probably survive for longer that we might imagine. St√©phane gave examples of military and insurance systems that have been around for 15/20 years, which seemed like a long time until I realised that &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/freerange/mocha&quot;&gt;Mocha&lt;/a&gt; has been around for about &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/freerange/mocha/commit/df720ef11f8cdb21cf5dfbc5f84f35e325fa8258&quot;&gt;8 years&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Robert Smallshire showed some graphs that suggest code is likely to outlast most other aspects of an organisation. By the time you‚Äôre working on a 20 year old codebase, you‚Äôre probably working in a team where only 20% have been around from the beginning.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Michael Feathers suggested we be more aware of how seemingly unrelated factors can affect the complexity of our code. He used the fascinating example of how &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.wired.com/wiredscience/2011/04/judges-mental-fatigue/&quot;&gt;parole is more likely to be granted at certain times of day&lt;/a&gt; to illustrate the sort of things we could be looking for.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I loved &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/mattwynne&quot;&gt;Matt Wynne&lt;/a&gt;‚Äôs metaphor that he uses to explain refactoring to non-developers: Think of developers as chefs, their output as meals and refactoring as keeping the kitchen clean. Matt also talked about analysing the commits in the new &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/cucumber/cucumber-ruby-core&quot;&gt;cucumber-ruby-core project&lt;/a&gt; and saying that he thinks that about 75% of the commits are refactoring commits.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/danielbrolund&quot;&gt;Daniel Brolund&lt;/a&gt; described how to use the Mikado method to ensure that we‚Äôre always reshaping the system to get it into a state that‚Äôs ready to accept new changes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/ivanrmoore&quot;&gt;Ivan Moore&lt;/a&gt; gave us some practical advice about &lt;a href=&quot;http://puttingtheteaintoteam.blogspot.co.uk/2014/02/making-life-easier-for-future-software.html&quot;&gt;being kind to our future selves in his lightning talk&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Deploying Rails apps using Recap, Apache and Passenger</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;This assumes that you already have &lt;a href=&quot;http://httpd.apache.org/&quot;&gt;Apache&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.phusionpassenger.com/&quot;&gt;Passenger&lt;/a&gt; installed; and that you‚Äôve run &lt;code&gt;recap setup&lt;/code&gt; and configured your &lt;code&gt;Capfile&lt;/code&gt; with the address of your server.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I‚Äôm going to use ‚Äòthames-time-lapse‚Äô as an example application name but you‚Äôll want to replace that with the name of your app in the instructions below.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The first step is to set-up the server and get the code deployed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;$ cap bootstrap
$ cap deploy:setup
$ cap deploy
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We now want to make &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/freerange/recap&quot;&gt;Recap‚Äôs&lt;/a&gt; configuration options available to Passenger. We can do this by changing the application user‚Äôs shell to bash and loading Recap‚Äôs environment variables in that user‚Äôs &lt;code&gt;.bashrc&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;# Set the app user&#39;s shell to bash
# So that Passenger can pick up environment variables from .bashrc
$ sudo chsh -s /bin/bash thames-time-lapse

# Create a .bashrc that loads the recap environment variables
$ sudo su - thames-time-lapse
$ echo &#39;source ~/.recap-env-export&#39; &amp;gt; ~/.bashrc
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Add an Apache virtual host for our application. Note that I‚Äôm setting the &lt;code&gt;PassengerRuby&lt;/code&gt; option as it defaults to the user that owns &lt;code&gt;config.ru&lt;/code&gt;, which happens to be the user that deployed rather than the application user.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;$ sudo vi /etc/apache2/sites-available/thames-time-lapse.chrisroos.co.uk.conf

# Paste the following content
&amp;lt;VirtualHost *:80&amp;gt;
  # Set PassengerRuby if you&#39;re using a non-system Ruby
  PassengerRuby /usr/local/bin/ruby
  # We have to set the user because config.ru is owned by the user that deployed
  PassengerUser thames-time-lapse
  ServerName thames-time-lapse.chrisroos.co.uk
  DocumentRoot /home/thames-time-lapse/app/public
  &amp;lt;Directory /home/thames-time-lapse/app/public&amp;gt;
    Allow from all
    Options -MultiViews
  &amp;lt;/Directory&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;/VirtualHost&amp;gt;

# Make the site available to Apache
$ sudo a2ensite thames-time-lapse.chrisroos.co.uk.conf

# Restart Apache
$ sudo service apache2 reload
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;All being well, your Rails app has now been deployed with Recap and is being served with Apache and Passenger.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The final step is to define the &lt;code&gt;deploy:restart&lt;/code&gt; Capistrano task so that the app is restarted after deployment. Add the following task to your Capfile.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;namespace :deploy do
  task :restart do
    as_app &#39;touch tmp/restart.txt&#39;
  end
end
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And that should be everything you need to get your app deployed using recap, and served by Apache and Passenger.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Moving my timelapse app from Heroku to AWS</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;I love &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.heroku.com/&quot;&gt;Heroku&lt;/a&gt; and tend to use the free resources to deploy apps when they‚Äôre in their very early stages of development. I have a few things that I continue to use Heroku for but unfortunately ran into some of the limits with the &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/chrisroos/thames-time-lapse&quot;&gt;Thames Time Lapse project&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The first limitation was the number of rows in the free development database. The dev plan gives you 10,000 rows for free but I managed to get up to around 150,000 before receiving a warning email from Heroku. I only create around 1,000 rows a day, and I‚Äôm nowhere near 150 days in, so I‚Äôd obviously screwed up somewhere along the line.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another limitation was in my use of the &lt;a href=&quot;http://rubygems.org/gems/s3&quot;&gt;S3 gem&lt;/a&gt; to find the new images that had been uploaded to S3. As far as I can tell the gem doesn‚Äôt understand S3 folders which meant that I had to scan the entire S3 bucket looking for new images. As more were uploaded, so this took longer and longer which just wasn‚Äôt sustainable. Moving to AWS has allowed me to use the excellent &lt;a href=&quot;http://s3tools.org/s3cmd&quot;&gt;s3cmd&lt;/a&gt; command line interface to greatly improve the performance of looking for new images.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Finally, having the app running on AWS should also make it easier to use imagemagick to create smaller versions of the images, and ffmpeg to automatically create a timelapse of each day of images.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Instructions for settings up an AWS instance (I‚Äôm using a free micro instance) are in the README of the application should you be so inclined to play along.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Time slice images of the Thames</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;This image was created by taking 24 images (well, I think it might actually be 23 because my maths was off) from the set I captured on the &lt;a href=&quot;http://thames-time-lapse.chrisroos.co.uk/days/2013-08-30&quot;&gt;30th August 2013&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/2013-08-30-thames-time-slice.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Time slice image of the Thames&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I played around with different numbers of images making up the final image, but felt that one per hour produces the best results.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I‚Äôve also had a bit of a play with creating a movie from a set of 27 of these time-slice images. I really like the undulating effect of the water. You can also view it on &lt;a href=&quot;https://vimeo.com/74574559&quot;&gt;Vimeo&lt;/a&gt; if you can‚Äôt see the video below.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Why split the subject and body in git commit messages?</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;Tim Pope‚Äôs, &lt;a href=&quot;http://tbaggery.com/2008/04/19/a-note-about-git-commit-messages.html&quot;&gt;‚ÄúA Note About Git Commit Messages‚Äù&lt;/a&gt; suggests that we should split our git commit message into subject and body, with a newline between the two. Tim lists some tools that make use of this split and I thought I‚Äôd follow that with some screenshots showing how this convention is used in four fairly common (well, I use them) git tools.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://mac.github.com/&quot;&gt;GitHub for Mac&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;

        <title>Automatically updating my desktop background from my Thames time lapse pictures</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;One of the things I wanted to do with the &lt;a href=&quot;/blog/2013-08-14-android-and-some-time-lapse-ish-magic&quot;&gt;pictures of the Thames that I‚Äôve been capturing&lt;/a&gt; is to periodically update my desktop background to show the most recent image.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I was investigating how best to hook it all up when I came across this article that describes how to &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.macosxautomation.com/automator/examples/ex08/03.html&quot;&gt;Set the Desktop Picture to NASA Image of the Day&lt;/a&gt;. I figured that I could add a feed of the recent images to the &lt;a href=&quot;http://thames-time-lapse.chrisroos.co.uk/images&quot;&gt;thames-time-lapse website&lt;/a&gt; and follow the same workflow to set my desktop background.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Once I had the workflow downloading images and automatically setting my desktop background, I added a cron job to execute that workflow every 15 minutes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another thing I‚Äôve been meaning to do is try to improve the quality of some of the images: They‚Äôre being taken through a pretty dirty window and suffer from both the dirt and reflections as the light changes during the day. I‚Äôm hoping that the increased visibility of the images will prompt me to do something about this sooner rather than later.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Listing controller filters in Rails 4</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;While trying to debug some &lt;a href=&quot;http://guides.rubyonrails.org/action_controller_overview.html#filters&quot;&gt;filter/callback&lt;/a&gt; weirdness in a Rails 4 app[1], I tried to work out how to list all the callbacks for an action. I spent a while digging through the code until I found out that you could get the callbacks from the &lt;code&gt;_process_action_callbacks&lt;/code&gt; method. So, popping something like this in your index action will write all the callbacks to the page. Magic.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;def index
  render text: self._process_action_callbacks
end
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;[1] There‚Äôs every chance that this same method works in earlier versions of Rails but I haven‚Äôt tried it.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Android and some time lapse(ish) magic</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;I‚Äôve often thought that it‚Äôd be cool if I could have a little Internet connected camera that I could put almost anywhere and have it regularly capture what it sees.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I‚Äôve recently been playing around with my old Samsung Galaxy S2 to see if it might be a suitable candidate, and it seems like it might just do the job. It‚Äôs been sitting on my windowsill looking out over the Thames and Canary Wharf since the 3rd of August and has captured 6,941 of the things it‚Äôs seen so far. Not only has it captured them but it‚Äôs also been automatically uploading them to Amazon S3. You can see the most recent[1] thing its seen by visiting &lt;a href=&quot;http://thames-time-lapse.chrisroos.co.uk&quot;&gt;http://thames-time-lapse.chrisroos.co.uk&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I have lots of things that I want to do with these images and the associated website but figured I‚Äôd use what I‚Äôve got so far as an excuse to try this blogging thing again.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;[1] &lt;em&gt;most recent&lt;/em&gt; isn‚Äôt quite accurate as the image you see may have been captured up to around 20 minutes ago - if it‚Äôs any longer than that then something has probably gone just a little bit horribly wrong.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Time Lapse Of The Thames And Canary Wharf</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;A time-lapse composed of 595 images (1 image every 30 seconds) from 13:40 to 18:43 on Sunday 3rd March 2013.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I took the pictures using &lt;a href=&quot;https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.ui.LapseItPro&amp;amp;hl=en&quot;&gt;LapseIt Pro&lt;/a&gt; on my Samsung Galaxy S2 at a resolution of 1920x1080. I turned the images into a movie using iMovie and by following this &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pHYtonER4VM&quot;&gt;youtube instructional video&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Investigation into CORS And XMLHttpRequest</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;It‚Äôs taken me a good couple of days to really understand the purpose of &lt;code&gt;withCredentials&lt;/code&gt;, and in particular the fact that it (currently, at least) has nothing to do with the username and password you can supply to &lt;code&gt;XMLHttpRequest.open()&lt;/code&gt;. I figured I‚Äôd write it up as it might save other people some time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The following examples all use the &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/chrisroos/rails-json-cors-and-http-auth&quot;&gt;rails-json-cors-and-http-auth&lt;/a&gt; Rails app which is currently hosted at &lt;a href=&quot;http://rails-json-cors-and-http-auth.herokuapp.com/&quot;&gt;http://rails-json-cors-and-http-auth.herokuapp.com/&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Where I talk about Chrome, Safari and Firefox, I‚Äôm talking specifically about Chrome Stable 25.0.1364.155, Safari 6.0.2 (8536.26.17) and Firefox 19.02.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Before CORS&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Before &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.w3.org/TR/cors/&quot;&gt;CORS&lt;/a&gt;, executing the following Javascript snippet from a domain other than the one hosting the Rails app (you can do this by visiting &lt;a href=&quot;http://example.com&quot;&gt;example.com&lt;/a&gt; and executing the javascript in Chrome‚Äôs developer console) would have resulted in an error.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;var url = &#39;http://rails-json-cors-and-http-auth.herokuapp.com/people&#39;;
var req = new XMLHttpRequest();
req.onload = function() { console.log(this.responseText); };
req.open(&#39;get&#39;, url, true);
req.setRequestHeader(&#39;Accept&#39;, &#39;application/json&#39;);
req.send();
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Chrome and Safari would warn you with:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;XMLHttpRequest cannot load http://rails-json-cors-and-http-auth.herokuapp.com/people. Origin http://www.iana.org is not allowed by Access-Control-Allow-Origin.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While Firefox warns you with the following slightly confusing error message (you can tell it‚Äôs an error because it‚Äôs in red (well, in Firefox it is, not here) and everything):&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;GET http://rails-json-cors-and-http-auth.herokuapp.com/people 200 OK.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;CORS to the rescue&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If we make that same request again (ensuring we‚Äôre still on a different domain to that of the Rails app), but this time tell the server to send us some CORS headers, we‚Äôll see that we can now make a cross domain Javascript GET request.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;var url = &#39;http://rails-json-cors-and-http-auth.herokuapp.com/people&#39;;
url = url + &#39;?enable_cors_headers=true&#39;;
var req = new XMLHttpRequest();
req.onload = function() { console.log(this.responseText); };
req.open(&#39;get&#39;, url, true);
req.setRequestHeader(&#39;Accept&#39;, &#39;application/json&#39;);
req.send();
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This was tested as working (i.e. the browser rendered the JSON response) in Chrome, Firefox and Safari.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;CORS and HTTP Basic Authentication without the &lt;code&gt;withCredentials&lt;/code&gt; option&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So far so good, but what happens if we protect our Rails app using HTTP Authentication?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;var url = &#39;http://rails-json-cors-and-http-auth.herokuapp.com/people&#39;;
url = url + &#39;?enable_cors_headers=true&amp;amp;enable_http_auth=true&#39;;
var req = new XMLHttpRequest();
req.onload = function() { console.log(this.responseText); };
req.open(&#39;get&#39;, url, true);
req.setRequestHeader(&#39;Accept&#39;, &#39;application/json&#39;);
req.send();
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Chrome and Safari offer up this error message:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;XMLHttpRequest cannot load http://rails-json-cors-and-http-auth.herokuapp.com/people?enable_cors_headers=true&amp;amp;enable_http_auth=true. Origin http://www.iana.org is not allowed by Access-Control-Allow-Origin.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It‚Äôs not immediately obvious what the problem is here unless you inspect the server logs and see the 401. I‚Äôd expect to be able to inspect the network request using the Chrome developer tools but they behave slightly oddly in this case: they don‚Äôt display the response even though the server sent one. Instead, they just display the GET request with a status of (canceled).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Firefox offers this slightly more helpful error message:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;‚ÄúNetworkError: 401 Unauthorized  - http://rails-json-cors-and-http-auth.herokuapp.com/people?enable_cors_headers=true&amp;amp;enable_http_auth=true‚Äù&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;CORS and HTTP Basic Authentication with the &lt;code&gt;withCredentials&lt;/code&gt; option&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;OK, so what‚Äôs the &lt;code&gt;withCredentials&lt;/code&gt; option all about? Let‚Äôs set it and find.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;var url = &#39;http://rails-json-cors-and-http-auth.herokuapp.com/people&#39;;
url = url + &#39;?enable_cors_headers=true&amp;amp;enable_http_auth=true&#39;;
var req = new XMLHttpRequest();
req.onload = function() { console.log(this.responseText); };
req.open(&#39;get&#39;, url, true);
req.setRequestHeader(&#39;Accept&#39;, &#39;application/json&#39;);
req.withCredentials = true;
req.send();
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Presuming you haven‚Äôt entered the HTTP auth username and password in your current session, here‚Äôs the behaviour you‚Äôll see:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Chrome and Safari will display the standard ‚Äònot allowed‚Äô error message:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;XMLHttpRequest cannot load http://rails-json-cors-and-http-auth.herokuapp.com/people?enable_cors_headers=true&amp;amp;enable_http_auth=true. Origin http://www.iana.org is not allowed by Access-Control-Allow-Origin.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Firefox will both display the following error message &lt;em&gt;and&lt;/em&gt; the basic auth popup allowing you to enter your credentials:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;‚ÄúNetworkError: 401 Unauthorized  - http://rails-json-cors-and-http-auth.herokuapp.com/people?enable_cors_headers=true&amp;amp;enable_http_auth=true‚Äù&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It‚Äôs worth noting here that Chrome Beta (26.0.1410.19) and Chrome Dev (27.0.1430.0) also show the HTTP auth popup dialog, which leads me to assume that the current behaviour (in Stable) is on the buggy side.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now, let‚Äôs do the same thing again but first enter our username/password in a different tab/window of the same browser session. If you‚Äôve done that and then replay the snippet from above you should see the JSON response correctly rendered in the Javascript console in all of Chrome, Safari and Firefox.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In summary, the use of &lt;code&gt;withCredentials&lt;/code&gt; tells all the browsers to send the Authorization header (and cookies but I‚Äôm not so interested in those) with the XMLHttpRequest. In addition, when set, it also allows Firefox to display the http auth dialog in response to a 401 from the XMLHttpRequest.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Wow that‚Äôs awesome, but what does this have to do with passing a username and password to &lt;code&gt;XMLHttpRequest.open()&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Well, it turns out that the answer to that is absolutely nothing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;var url = &#39;http://rails-json-cors-and-http-auth.herokuapp.com/people&#39;;
url = url + &#39;?enable_cors_headers=true&amp;amp;enable_http_auth=true&#39;;
var req = new XMLHttpRequest();
req.onload = function() { console.log(this.responseText); };
req.open(&#39;get&#39;, url, true, &#39;username&#39;, &#39;password&#39;);
req.setRequestHeader(&#39;Accept&#39;, &#39;application/json&#39;);
req.withCredentials = true;
req.send();
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Execute this snippet (note the setting of the username and password in &lt;code&gt;open()&lt;/code&gt;) in a new browser session and you‚Äôll the following behaviour.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In Chrome and Safari we see our standard ‚Äònot allowed‚Äô error message:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;XMLHttpRequest cannot load http://rails-json-cors-and-http-auth.herokuapp.com/people?enable_cors_headers=true&amp;amp;enable_http_auth=true. Origin http://www.iana.org is not allowed by Access-Control-Allow-Origin.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In addition, we can observe that the Authorization header isn‚Äôt constructed or sent, causing the server to respond with a 401. We see the same odd behaviour where the Chrome Developer tools show the GET request as (canceled) and doesn‚Äôt show the response at all.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Firefox displays a different error to any that we‚Äôve seen before:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;‚ÄúError: Access to restricted URI denied‚Äù&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Interestingly enough, we don‚Äôt see any request being made to the server in this case so something in the code must be stopping the request from even going out.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Finally, manually setting the Authorization header&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is just here for a bit of completeness, really. It demonstrates that given the &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/chrisroos/rails-json-cors-and-http-auth/commit/800ad64186f3d8814d8dcde0005225ce43af5172&quot;&gt;relevant CORS headers&lt;/a&gt;, and client side logic (to generate the username/password hash) you can avoid the use of &lt;code&gt;withCredentials&lt;/code&gt; and of supplying the username and password to &lt;code&gt;open()&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;NOTE&lt;/em&gt; The username/password hash below is hardcoded to that of ‚Äòusername‚Äô and ‚Äòpassword‚Äô.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;var url = &#39;http://rails-json-cors-and-http-auth.herokuapp.com/people&#39;;
url = url + &#39;?enable_cors_headers=true&amp;amp;enable_http_auth=true&#39;;
var req = new XMLHttpRequest();
req.onload = function() { console.log(this.responseText); };
req.open(&#39;get&#39;, url, true);
req.setRequestHeader(&#39;Accept&#39;, &#39;application/json&#39;);
req.setRequestHeader(&#39;Authorization&#39;, &#39;Basic dXNlcm5hbWU6cGFzc3dvcmQ=&#39;);
req.send();
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;What does this all even mean&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This whole investigation started because I wanted to add a JSON API to &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/chrisroos/roosmarks&quot;&gt;Roosmarks&lt;/a&gt; so that I could build a &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/chrisroos/roosmarks-chrome-extension&quot;&gt;Chrome extension&lt;/a&gt;. State changing actions on Roosmarks are protected by http authentication so I‚Äôd hoped to be able to have the extension authenticate to Roosmarks in order to provide a fairly seemless experience. It doesn‚Äôt look like this is going to be possible but, having done all this investigation, I‚Äôm not so worried about it anymore: I‚Äôm pretty happy that the extension can rely on the user having previously authenticated to Roosmarks before it works as expected. In fact, there‚Äôs every chance that I won‚Äôt even use the JSON API in the extension, and just render the actual website itself. I need to explore than idea further, though.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Bookmark printing service for the Go Free Range Printer platform</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;I‚Äôve spent the last couple of days creating a simple service for the &lt;a href=&quot;http://gofreerange.com/printer&quot;&gt;Printer platform&lt;/a&gt;.  This service allows you to print a bookmark (in the traditional sense) for the book you‚Äôre reading.  Although it‚Äôs probably of most use to those people with their own printers, you can definitely have a play with generating your own bookmarks (and see a printed example) over on the &lt;a href=&quot;http://printer-bookmarks.heroku.com/&quot;&gt;Printer bookmarks app on Heroku&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The idea of a book-specific bookmark, on which I can record when I start and finish along with some reading notes, appeals to me.  I can actually imagine that a custom bookmark printing service like this might be useful outside of this little experiment with the Printer platform.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Developing this little bookmark application (&lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/freerange/printer-bookmarks&quot;&gt;source on github&lt;/a&gt;) allowed me to use the Printer platform in anger, which was great as I‚Äôd only really been following &lt;a href=&quot;http://gofreerange.com/james-adam&quot;&gt;James A&lt;/a&gt;‚Äôs impressive work from the sidelines.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Building the bookmark service&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The rest of this post is a fairly high level view of how I approached the development of this little service.  Hopefully I‚Äôll convey how simple it is to build your own Printer service.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I started by looking at the example &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/freerange/printer-mail&quot;&gt;Printer Mail&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/freerange/printer-paint&quot;&gt;Printer Paint&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/freerange/printer-weather&quot;&gt;Printer Weather&lt;/a&gt; apps.  While these services are geared toward sending content (from a person in the case of mail and paint, and from a machine in the case of weather) to another person‚Äôs printer, I think the bookmark service is most useful for someone wanting to print to their own printer.  This made my life a little easier as it meant I didn‚Äôt need to worry about storing printer details in my app: I could rely on the user entering their printer address at the time they wanted to print the bookmark.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The first thing I did was create a simple html bookmark (see &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/freerange/printer-bookmarks/commit/7652ba185832ecf1e7e7bad44442d4292b5d5e1a&quot;&gt;7652ba&lt;/a&gt;) that I could preview using the &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/freerange/printer/wiki/API&quot;&gt;Printer API&lt;/a&gt; (you can think of the Printer API as something like &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.google.com/cloudprint/learn/&quot;&gt;Google Cloud Print&lt;/a&gt; for receipt printers).  Once happy that the preview looked OK I moved on to making the bookmark dynamic based on a supplied Amazon URL (see &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/freerange/printer-bookmarks/commit/3f5377c3b8809565ebb6cc26aad11075a073a625&quot;&gt;3f5377&lt;/a&gt;).  The addition of some tests allowed me to refactor the code in preparation for the simple Sinatra web interface (see &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/freerange/printer-bookmarks/commit/a75e4aa20a3eb3f3f90480636719443322841502&quot;&gt;a75e4a&lt;/a&gt;).  Once able to view the bookmarks in a browser I wanted them to look a little closer to how they‚Äôd look once printed.  Fortunately, I was able to borrow the template from the Printer Mail app to do just that (see &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/freerange/printer-bookmarks/commit/0ba53664fc3cfa091567ef678cad0211811acb8e&quot;&gt;0ba536&lt;/a&gt;).  I had the app deployed to &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.heroku.com/&quot;&gt;Heroku&lt;/a&gt; by this time so I was ‚Äúdone‚Äù in the most simple of senses: I could use the publicly accessible bookmark preview (e.g. &lt;a href=&quot;http://printer-bookmarks.heroku.com/bookmark?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.co.uk%2FThe-Vinci-Code-Dan-Brown%2Fdp%2F0552149519%2Fref%3Dsr_1_2%3Fie%3DUTF8%26qid%3D1334252406%26sr%3D8-2&quot;&gt;bookmark for The Da Vinci Code&lt;/a&gt;) to print to the &lt;a href=&quot;http://printer.gofreerange.com/&quot;&gt;Go Free Range Printer backend&lt;/a&gt;.  After that, apart from making it easier to print (see &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/freerange/printer-bookmarks/commit/d84b751bda676fefceb286519cda31d6610b7e79&quot;&gt;d84b75&lt;/a&gt;) and preview (see &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/freerange/printer-bookmarks/commit/617d24ff5d1ed2460b151aa09f4cbfa2f510015b&quot;&gt;617d24&lt;/a&gt;) bookmarks, the remainder of the changes were mainly aesthetic.  Pretty simple, huh.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For more information about the Printer platform and how to get involved, checkout any or all of the &lt;a href=&quot;http://gofreerange.com/hello-printer&quot;&gt;introductory blog post&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/freerange/printer/wiki&quot;&gt;Printer wiki&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=&quot;http://gofreerange.com/printer&quot;&gt;Printer platform&lt;/a&gt;.

        <title>Getting Started With Asterisk And Adhearsion On A Mac</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;These are some basic notes that should enable you to get &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.asterisk.org/&quot;&gt;Asterisk&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;http://adhearsion.com/&quot;&gt;Adhearsion&lt;/a&gt; up and running on a Mac.  You‚Äôll need &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/mxcl/homebrew&quot;&gt;homebrew&lt;/a&gt; in order to install Asterisk.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are slightly more detailed &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/adhearsion/adhearsion/wiki/Getting-Started&quot;&gt;Getting Started instructions&lt;/a&gt; on the Adhearsion wiki should you wish to explore further.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Install Asterisk&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;NOTE&lt;/em&gt; Asterisk, by default, doesn‚Äôt come with any config files.  You can install the sample config files by supplying the &lt;code&gt;--with-sample-config&lt;/code&gt; flag to the command below.  It might be an idea to install Asterisk with the sample config files and move them elsewhere on your system to refer back to.  The rest of these notes assume that you don‚Äôt have any asterisk configuration files.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;$ brew install asterisk
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Generate basic configuration files to allow us to test that Asterisk is working&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;# Load all modules so that Asterisk can understand SIP, among other things
$ cat &amp;gt; `brew --prefix`/etc/asterisk/modules.conf
[modules]
autoload=yes
&amp;lt;ctrl-d&amp;gt;

# Create a demo context that answers extension 1 and plays &#39;hello world&#39;
$ cat &amp;gt; `brew --prefix`/etc/asterisk/extensions.conf
[hello-world-demo]
exten =&amp;gt; 1,1,Playback(hello-world)
&amp;lt;ctrl-d&amp;gt;

# Create a device that will forward all calls to our demo context
$ cat &amp;gt; `brew --prefix`/etc/asterisk/sip.conf
[softphone]
type=friend
secret=password
host=dynamic
context=hello-world-demo
&amp;lt;ctrl-d&amp;gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Start Asterisk&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;$ asterisk
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Testing the Asterisk configuration&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Install the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.tlphn.com/&quot;&gt;Telephone&lt;/a&gt; app from the App Store.  &lt;em&gt;NOTE&lt;/em&gt; Although possibly not the most stable of software I prefer the simplicity of this softphone over some of the others available.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Add an account using the following details:&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;ul&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;Full Name: Anything you like&lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;Domain: localhost&lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;User Name: softphone (this corresponds to the name of the device in sip.conf)&lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;Password: password (this corresponds to the secret defined in the ‚Äòsoftphone‚Äô device in sip.conf)&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;/ul&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Dial extension 1 (i.e. the number 1).&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Confirm that you hear the ‚Äòhello world‚Äô message.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Install Adhearsion&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This installs version 1.0.2 at the time of writing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;$ gem install adhearsion
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Create an Adhearsion project&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;$ ahn create ~/sample-adhearsion-project
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Configure the Adhearsion project&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We need to create a ‚Äòhello_world_demo‚Äô context to mirror the ‚Äòhello-world-demo‚Äô context we created above in extensions.conf.  The ‚Äòsimon_game‚Äô line tells adhearsion to use the simon_game component that you‚Äôll find in ~/sample-adhearsion-project/components.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;$ cd ~/sample-adhearsion-project
$ cat &amp;gt;&amp;gt; dialplan.rb
hello_world_demo {
  simon_game
}
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Start the Adhearsion server&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;$ cd ~/sample-adhearsion-project
$ ahn start .
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Extend the Asterisk configuration files with the location of our Adhearsion server&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This assumes you followed the instructions above exactly as they were written, i.e. this is going to add to the ‚Äòhello-world-demo‚Äô context in extensions.conf.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;$ cat &amp;gt;&amp;gt; `brew --prefix`/etc/asterisk/extensions.conf
exten =&amp;gt; 2,1,AGI(agi://localhost)
&amp;lt;ctrl-d&amp;gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Start Asterisk&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You‚Äôll probably want to do this in another terminal window unless you started the adhearsion server as a daemon.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;$ asterisk
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Test that Adhearsion and Asterisk are configured to work together&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Use the telephone app mentioned above but this time dial extension 2 (i.e. number 2) rather than extension 1.  You should be prompted to play the &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Simon_(game)&quot;&gt;Simon game&lt;/a&gt;: simply repeat the numbers that you hear read out.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And that‚Äôs hopefully all there is to get Asterisk and Adhearsion set-up end to end on your Mac.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Day notes - Tue 15th Feb 2011</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://kalv.co.uk/&quot;&gt;Kalv&lt;/a&gt; and I paired on some message encoding oddness we‚Äôre seeing with certain messages coming to us from the SMSCs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://tomafro.net/&quot;&gt;Tom&lt;/a&gt; and I paired to investigate some spikes in load we were seeing on our application server after re-enabling a number of &lt;a href=&quot;https://hashblue.com/&quot;&gt;#blue&lt;/a&gt; users yesterday.  We‚Äôre fairly confident we found at least two of the main offenders: removing conversations and cancelling accounts were both using grossly inefficient queries.  We‚Äôve tidied these up and re-deployed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I saw &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alex_Ebert&quot;&gt;Alexander&lt;/a&gt; (off of &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edward_Sharpe_and_the_Magnetic_Zeros&quot;&gt;Edward Sharpe and the Magnetic Zeros&lt;/a&gt;) at &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.thecamplondon.com/&quot;&gt;The City Arts &amp;amp; Music Project&lt;/a&gt;.  It was great.  You can listen to the single, &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_atFMCUJ1o&quot;&gt;Truth&lt;/a&gt;, on youtube.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Day notes - Mon 14th Feb 2011</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://tomafro.net/&quot;&gt;Tom&lt;/a&gt; started to re-enable some of our existing &lt;a href=&quot;https://hashblue.com/&quot;&gt;#blue&lt;/a&gt; accounts now that we‚Äôve pretty much got everything we need to integrate fully with &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.o2.co.uk/&quot;&gt;O2&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Paired with &lt;a href=&quot;http://kalv.co.uk/&quot;&gt;Kalv&lt;/a&gt; on getting the latest version of the &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/freerange/ruby-smpp&quot;&gt;ruby-smpp&lt;/a&gt; library into #blue.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We started to investigate some errors with messages containing invalid UTF-8 encoding.  In the process we noticed that these errors weren‚Äôt being sent to &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.getexceptional.com/&quot;&gt;getexceptional&lt;/a&gt;.  A little bit of investigation led us to believe that it‚Äôs a problem with getexceptional itself (as per &lt;a href=&quot;http://support.getexceptional.com/discussions/problems/340-invalid-utf8-exceptions-not-being-captured&quot;&gt;this ticket&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I watched &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0887912/&quot;&gt;The Hurt Locker&lt;/a&gt;.  It was good.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Day notes - Fri 11th Feb 2011</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;After a little more investigation, I wrote up a &lt;a href=&quot;http://jgarber.lighthouseapp.com/projects/13054-redcloth/tickets/210-redcloth-426-is-broken-on-mac-os-x&quot;&gt;ticket for the RedCloth 4.2.6 issue&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Day notes - Thu 10th Feb 2011</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;Continued working on &lt;a href=&quot;http://mubi.com/&quot;&gt;mubi&lt;/a&gt; with &lt;a href=&quot;http://kalv.co.uk/&quot;&gt;Kalv&lt;/a&gt;.  We looked at upgrading the app to rails 3.  We used the &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/rails/rails_upgrade&quot;&gt;rails upgrade plugin&lt;/a&gt; and started to make some of the simpler changes (RAILS_ENV etc).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Continued on the rails 3 upgrade with &lt;a href=&quot;http://interblah.net/&quot;&gt;James A&lt;/a&gt;.  Took a slightly different approach.  Updated to rails 3 in an attempt to see what needed to be changed.  We got a certain way through before getting pretty stuck on the routes.  The task in the plugin that attempts to upgrade the routes doesn‚Äôt work for certain route definitions.  In addition, one of the libraries that we ended up updating resulted in &lt;a href=&quot;http://redcloth.org/&quot;&gt;RedCloth&lt;/a&gt; 4.2.6 being installed.  It turns out that this just doesn‚Äôt work on Mac OS X.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I started investigating the cause of RedCloth 4.2.6 not working.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We took delivery of some Ikea furniture for the office.&lt;/p&gt;

        <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://mongoid.org/&quot;&gt;Mongoid&lt;/a&gt; doesn‚Äôt support migrations out of the box.  Although it has a rake task to create indexes on collections, there is no nice way to remove them.  There is &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/adacosta/mongoid_rails_migrations&quot;&gt;mongoid_rails_migrations&lt;/a&gt; but that doesn‚Äôt work with mongoid releases after 2.0.0.rc.1 (see &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/adacosta/mongoid_rails_migrations/issues/issue/7&quot;&gt;issue 7&lt;/a&gt;).  One solution is to create a standard active record migration and do something like the &lt;a href=&quot;https://gist.github.com/818493&quot;&gt;example in this gist&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I started working on GFRs new project this afternoon.  I got set-up and updated the developer set-up notes in the process.  Wrote an email about the merits of either migrations and/or having an up-to-date schema.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Watched &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1183911/&quot;&gt;Mr Nice&lt;/a&gt; - it was good.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Day notes - Tue 8th Feb 2011</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;Had a bit of a general discussion around our &lt;a href=&quot;http://gofreerange.com/&quot;&gt;Go Free Range&lt;/a&gt; accounts.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We ended up carrying over some of our &lt;a href=&quot;https://hashblue.com/&quot;&gt;#blue&lt;/a&gt; signup discussion from yesterday.  Although this felt a bit like going over old ground it was actually really useful.  It made us really focus on what we were trying to achieve, i.e. the problems we were trying to solve, and allowed us to get rid of some of the stories we came up with yesterday.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://interblah.net/&quot;&gt;James A&lt;/a&gt; and I paired on moving the phone number from the beta request sign up, to the account sign up.  The way that #blue used to integrate with Bluebook meant that we required the number up front to check whether you were an existing customer.  This is no longer the case so we think we can make it simpler for new users to request an invite.&lt;/p&gt;

        <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://kalv.co.uk/&quot;&gt;Kalv&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;http://jasoncale.com/&quot;&gt;Jase&lt;/a&gt; and I spent some time discussing a new &lt;a href=&quot;https://hashblue.com&quot;&gt;#blue&lt;/a&gt; sign-up process.  It became clear after trying to implement our plan that we hadn‚Äôt quite thought it through enough and we went back to the drawing board.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I came off my bike last Friday and, although it looks fine to me, it‚Äôs felt a little off balance since so I took it to the shop for them to have a little look at.  I kinda hope there‚Äôs actually something wrong with it and it‚Äôs not just the fact that I‚Äôve forgotten how to cycle.  That‚Äôd be embarrassing.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Day notes - Fri 4th Feb 2011</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;We had a general company chat about an internal messaging app we‚Äôve been developing (a chat frontend of which is available as &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/freerange/teamstream&quot;&gt;Teamstream&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We managed to get &lt;a href=&quot;http://tomafro.net/&quot;&gt;Tom‚Äôs&lt;/a&gt; mobile number re-provisioned through the new mechanism that‚Äôll hopefully support us re-enabling the existing &lt;a href=&quot;https://hashblue.com/&quot;&gt;#blue&lt;/a&gt; functionality that was removed at Christmas and allow us to sign up many more customers.&lt;/p&gt;

It turns out that they‚Äôre looking to hire Ruby developers to work in The O2 Labs department.  Get in touch if you think it‚Äôs something you might be interested in.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Day notes - Wed 2nd Feb 2011</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://tomafro.net/&quot;&gt;Tom&lt;/a&gt; and I fixed a couple of small bugs in &lt;a href=&quot;https://hashblue.com/&quot;&gt;#blue&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Invite URLs had changed and some of the older ones were no longer working.  We added a legacy route to ensure the old invites continued to work.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;It was possible to access the new account page without an invite.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We worked through some network shenanigans to allow us to communicate with the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.o2.co.uk/&quot;&gt;O2&lt;/a&gt; abs so that we can start provisioning customers again.&lt;/p&gt;

        <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://tomafro.net/&quot;&gt;Tom&lt;/a&gt; and I spent some time on a call with O2 chatting about phone number re-use and &lt;a href=&quot;https://hashblue.com/&quot;&gt;#blue&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Tom and I investigated a problem with new messages not being imported into #blue.  It turns out that the default &lt;a href=&quot;http://mongoid.org/&quot;&gt;Mongoid&lt;/a&gt; behaviour is to ‚Äòfire and forget‚Äô.  So, although our messages were falling foul of a unique index constraint in Mongo, Mongoid was responding as if they‚Äôd be saved correctly.  See &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/mongoid/mongoid/issues/642&quot;&gt;Mongoid issue 642&lt;/a&gt; for a little more information.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Day notes - Mon 31st Jan 2011</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;We‚Äôre getting closer to having &lt;a href=&quot;https://hashblue.com/&quot;&gt;#blue&lt;/a&gt; fully integrated with all the relevant services within &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.o2.co.uk/&quot;&gt;O2&lt;/a&gt;.  We had to make a couple of small changes to ensure that #blue could talk to the O2 production network.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://tomafro.net/&quot;&gt;Tom&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;http://interblah.net/&quot;&gt;James A&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;http://jamesmead.org/&quot;&gt;James M&lt;/a&gt; and I were out visiting a new client this afternoon.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I used &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.myhammer.co.uk/&quot;&gt;MyHammer&lt;/a&gt; this evening to get quotes for some DIY.  Let‚Äôs see how that works out..&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Day notes - Sun 30th Jan 2011</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;I finished listening to &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.audible.co.uk/aduk/site/product.jsp?p=BK_HODD_000094UK&quot;&gt;An Evening with Ranulph Fiennes&lt;/a&gt;.  It‚Äôs a seriously good listen and I‚Äôd recommend it to anyone.  It‚Äôs a recording of a talk he gave in front of an audience and it sounds as though there were probably slides to go along with it: I don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs made any worse by the lack of slides but I suspect they might‚Äôve made some of the funnier points even funnier.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I finished reading &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.amazon.co.uk/Hardcore-Zen-Monster-Movies-Reality/dp/086171380X&quot;&gt;Hardcore Zen&lt;/a&gt; that &lt;a href=&quot;http://jasoncale.com/&quot;&gt;Jase&lt;/a&gt; lent me.  I enjoyed it and think I might even understand some of it.  It‚Äôll definitely require a re-read though.&lt;/p&gt;

        <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://tomafro.net/&quot;&gt;Tom&lt;/a&gt; and I paired on fixing our CI machine.  The way in which it was re-provisioned meant that certain application dependencies were missing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I spent some time this afternoon working on a little project that‚Äôll allow me to upload my bank transactions to a Google Spreadsheet to track my spending.  The code‚Äôs in the &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/chrisroos/ofx-to-csv&quot;&gt;ofx-to-csv&lt;/a&gt; repository and currently comprises a script to convert &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open_Financial_Exchange&quot;&gt;OFX&lt;/a&gt; to &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CSV&quot;&gt;CSV&lt;/a&gt; and a &lt;a href=&quot;http://code.google.com/googleapps/appsscript/&quot;&gt;Google Apps Script&lt;/a&gt; to remove duplicate transactions from the Google Spreadsheet.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Day notes - Thu 27th Jan 2011</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;Fixed some failing tests in &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/freerange/teamstream&quot;&gt;Team Stream&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://interblah.net/&quot;&gt;James A&lt;/a&gt; and I paired on debugging some problems we were experiencing with our &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WebSockets&quot;&gt;WebSocket&lt;/a&gt; powered internal chat app.  The problem appeared to be that the WebSocket connection died when the network disconnected and reconnected.  I ended up creating a really simple &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/chrisroos/websocket-echo-server-example&quot;&gt;WebSocket echo server&lt;/a&gt; that seemed to prove that what we were seeing wasn‚Äôt normal WebSocket behaviour.  Making some changes to our own code (that was attempting to monitor the state of the connection and re-connect when necessary) appears to have fixed the problem.  Which is nice.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://interblah.net/&quot;&gt;James A&lt;/a&gt; and I paired on getting our own Linode instance (hosting &lt;a href=&quot;http://gofreerange.com/&quot;&gt;gofreerange.com&lt;/a&gt;) re-provisioned using our &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/freerange/freerange-puppet&quot;&gt;Puppet recipes&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I booked some tickets for the &lt;a href=&quot;http://blog.newhumanist.org.uk/2010/12/science-on-tour-robin-inces-uncaged.html&quot;&gt;Uncaged Monkeys&lt;/a&gt; show in May.&lt;/p&gt;

        <description>&lt;p&gt;I spent quite a while investigating a problem with installing &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/tenderlove/nokogiri/&quot;&gt;Nokogiri&lt;/a&gt;.  It turned out to be a problem with a version of &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.gnu.org/software/libiconv/&quot;&gt;libiconv&lt;/a&gt; I had installed.  I added some details to &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/tenderlove/nokogiri/issues/#issue/381/comment/706790&quot;&gt;Nokogiri issue 381&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

        <description>&lt;p&gt;We ordered some &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.ikea.com/&quot;&gt;Designer Swedish furniture&lt;/a&gt; for the office.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I fixed up our CI dashboard.  Although it hadn‚Äôt been working for a while (we were relying on other notifications for build changes) I was missing the &lt;a href=&quot;http://ccmenu.sourceforge.net/&quot;&gt;CC Menu&lt;/a&gt; compatible feed that it provided.  It turned out that an upgrade of &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.modrails.com/&quot;&gt;Passenger&lt;/a&gt; was all that was required to fix it.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Day notes - Sun 23rd Jan 2011</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;Watched two excellent climbing films, both recommended by &lt;a href=&quot;http://twitter.com/bensales&quot;&gt;Ben Sales&lt;/a&gt;: &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.theasgardproject.com/&quot;&gt;The Asgard Project&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.bigupproductions.com/#/films/Progression/&quot;&gt;Progression&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Started listening to &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.audible.co.uk/aduk/site/product.jsp?p=BK_HODD_000094UK&quot;&gt;An evening with Ranulph Fiennes&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

        <description>&lt;p&gt;I picked up my bike from the shop.  It‚Äôs much much much better now that it has MORE POWER.  I also bought some waterproof shorts in the hope that it‚Äôll make it slightly more comfortable to cycle in the rain.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Day notes - Thu 20th Jan 2011</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;I popped my bike into &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.onyourbike.com/&quot;&gt;On your bike&lt;/a&gt; so that they can add MORE POWER.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I spent a good few hours looking through a project in order to evaluate whether it‚Äôd be useful to continue development or whether to start over.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I spent a little while writing about some &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/chrisroos/http-302-curl-test&quot;&gt;cURL oddness with 302s and changing http methods&lt;/a&gt; that I noticed quite a while ago.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I booked a place in the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.snowdoniaslateman.com/&quot;&gt;Snowdonia Slateman Triathlon&lt;/a&gt; after getting some really helpful advice from one of the organisers.  Now all I need to do is get a suitable bike.  Oh, and do some training or summit.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Day notes - Wed 19th Jan 2011</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;I paired with &lt;a href=&quot;http://jamesmead.org/&quot;&gt;James M&lt;/a&gt; a little on some work he‚Äôd done to replace &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/tobi/delayed_job&quot;&gt;delayed_job&lt;/a&gt; with &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/bvandenbos/resque-scheduler&quot;&gt;resque-scheduler&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I spent some time investigating shared address book type functionality in Google Apps for your domains.  It would appear that there are some paid-for apps in the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.google.com/enterprise/marketplace/&quot;&gt;Apps Marketplace&lt;/a&gt; and a &lt;a href=&quot;http://code.google.com/googleapps/domain/shared_contacts/gdata_shared_contacts_api_reference.html&quot;&gt;Shared Contacts API&lt;/a&gt; available to Business and Education GAFYD accounts.  I did a little &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/chrisroos/google-apps-shared-contacts-api-spike&quot;&gt;spiking with the API&lt;/a&gt; and, although you can create and list ‚Äòshared contacts‚Äô they don‚Äôt actually appear in the GMail client or Contact Editor.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Day notes - Sat 15th Jan 2011</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;I went to &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.theoutdoorsshow.co.uk/&quot;&gt;the Outdoors show&lt;/a&gt; and saw some climbing, some great bike trickery from &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.mb7.com/TheClan/&quot;&gt;The Clan&lt;/a&gt; and talks by &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.raymears.com/&quot;&gt;Ray Mears&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.benfogle.com/&quot;&gt;Ben Fogle&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The talks were really interesting.  The main thing I took away from Ray‚Äôs talk was the importance of the journey (versus the destination): The difference, in bushcraft terms, between being able to &lt;em&gt;survive&lt;/em&gt; in the wild for a short period of time and being able to &lt;em&gt;live&lt;/em&gt; in the wild.  I also really respect Ray‚Äôs depth of knowledge in the subjects he spoke about.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ben‚Äôs talk was a brief history of his life and the challenges he‚Äôs undertaken.  I‚Äôd read &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.amazon.co.uk/gp/product/184354511X&quot;&gt;The Crossing&lt;/a&gt; and watched &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.amazon.co.uk/Thin-Ice-DVD-Ben-Fogle/dp/B0028QGYZY&quot;&gt;On Thin Ice&lt;/a&gt; and really enjoyed them both.  Not wishing to take anything away from Ben‚Äôs achievements, he makes it seem as though anyone can take on these sort of epic challenges, which is really inspiring.  One thing I didn‚Äôt realise until seeing the talk was that &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/entertainment-arts-10728094&quot;&gt;James Cracknell was in a serious road accident in July 2010&lt;/a&gt;.  James has &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.telegraph.co.uk/sport/columnists/jamescracknell/8023949/James-Cracknell-I-feel-so-lucky-to-be-alive-but-Ill-never-be-the-same-again.html&quot;&gt;written about his recovery in the Telegraph&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Day notes - Fri 14th Jan 2011</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;I transcribed the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.bbc.co.uk/radio4/features/you-and-yours/&quot;&gt;You and Yours&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/p00d4n2l&quot;&gt;segment on National Rail Enquiries&lt;/a&gt; from the 6th Jan 2011.  I‚Äôm interested in National Rail‚Äôs approach to third parties using their data (I was asked to &lt;a href=&quot;http://chrisroos.co.uk/blog/2009-01-31-turning-off-my-national-rail-twitter-bot&quot;&gt;turn off a twitter bot&lt;/a&gt; I wrote) and wanted the content of this interview to stick around even if/when the audio disapears.  I was genuinely surprised by how time consuming this was: It took the best part of three hours to transcribe this nine and half minute clip, comprised of a first pass (much pausing, playing and rewinding) to grab most of the content and multiple post passes to check the transcription and timestamps.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I have some thoughts about the National Rail approach but will write them up separately.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I got a reply from You and Yours about transcripts.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Many thanks for you query:  I‚Äôm afraid we don‚Äôt have the resources to transcribe every ‚ÄúYou and Yours‚Äù item (only items relating to disability), which is why the programmes are available on-line, and are now divided into ‚Äòchapters‚Äô to make it easier to find the bit you want.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It turns out that this is stated on the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b006qps9&quot;&gt;You and Yours Programmes page&lt;/a&gt; but not on the transcripts page itself.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Day notes - Thu 13th Jan 2011</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://interblah.net/&quot;&gt;James A&lt;/a&gt; and I got the production &lt;a href=&quot;https://hashblue.com/&quot;&gt;#blue&lt;/a&gt; server re-provisioned using our &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.puppetlabs.com/&quot;&gt;Puppet&lt;/a&gt; scripts.  This is essentially what the last week has been leading up to so it feels great to finally get the server rebuilt.  Our original thought was to rebuild the current production server but &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.linode.com/&quot;&gt;Linode&lt;/a&gt; made it really easy for us to build a new production instance, check that the app was working correctly, and then swap the IP addresses between the two boxes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It‚Äôs definitely been a bit of a struggle to keep motivated during this phase of Puppet work. I think I‚Äôll put that down to the lack of immediate feedback you get with this sort of longer running work.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Transcript Of You And Yours From The 6th Jan 2011</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;This is a transcript of &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/p00d4n2l&quot;&gt;Chapter three&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b00x7c36&quot;&gt;You and Yours from the 6th Jan 2011&lt;/a&gt;.  I transcribed it because I think it makes interesting listening/reading.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Winifred Robinson (15:33)&lt;/strong&gt;: Clever computer programmes that use up to the minute information on buses and trains means that you can now do all kinds of fancy things when it comes to planning your journey.  But National Rail Enquiries has decided to charge people who want to make use of its real time data, that‚Äôs the facts about the train times, rather than what the timetables say.  It‚Äôs a change of policy, and some people, including Gordon Brown when he was Prime Minister, think the information from publicly funded bodies should always be free.  Alex Hewson is a web developer who created an application for mobile phones where users could get some of this live time/live train information, and he was told by National Rail Enquiries to close it down.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Alex Hewson (16:13)&lt;/strong&gt;: There are two different things an app can be. In the case of what I built, it‚Äôs a very simple cutdown website.  It‚Äôs a very simple website which is aimed at mobile phone users. You can click a link on your phone and it‚Äôll tell you the next five trains from your home town to wherever you‚Äôd like to go.  It can also mean a programme that you pay for in an app store, like the apple version where you‚Äôll pay a certain amount of money for it and it installs on your phone.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Winifred Robinson (16:35)&lt;/strong&gt;: But typically, people like you are dreaming up.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Alex Hewson (16:37)&lt;/strong&gt;: Yes, that‚Äôs right, yes, yes.  And it was just an idea I had out of the blue really.  I became aware that the data was available and it seemed like it would be very useful if I could click a button on my phone every morning and find when the next five trains to work were.  It took half a day to write, it was nothing very special, nothing very difficult.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Winifred Robinson (16:54)&lt;/strong&gt;: You were not making any profit from it.  You just made it for your own use and then shared it with friends, is that right?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Alex Hewson (16:59)&lt;/strong&gt;: Absolutely, yes that‚Äôs right.  In fact, the first version would only deal with trains from where I live.  It was only after people asked that I made it work with other people‚Äôs stations as well.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Winifred Robinson (17:07)&lt;/strong&gt;: And the important thing is that you were able to find out the real running times of the trains, and not just the timetable.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Alex Hewson (17:13)&lt;/strong&gt;: Absolutely, yes that‚Äôs right.  Cancellations, late departures, things like that.  All of these were produced by the servers that were run by National Rail Enquiries, and they were all publicly available.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Winifred Robinson (17:24)&lt;/strong&gt;: Now, National Rail Enquiries told you that you must close down this application.  What reasons did they give?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Alex Hewson (17:32)&lt;/strong&gt;: They didn‚Äôt really give any, good, reasons.  They said a licence had always been required, it‚Äôs just that they hadn‚Äôt really enforced it very well before.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Winifred Robinson (17:39)&lt;/strong&gt;: Now, what would the licence mean?  Presumably you would have to pay for it?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Alex Hewson (17:42)&lt;/strong&gt;: Well, that‚Äôs what they said.  I said, first of all, is this going to be a free or paid licence and they said it‚Äôs going to be/very likely to be paid for, and of course I wasn‚Äôt very impressed by that.  You know, I‚Äôd never made any money out of the application, the data was always freely available before, and it seemed that shutting down this thing that they‚Äôd already built and was already free to the public, it seemed a bit off really.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Winifred Robinson (18:01)&lt;/strong&gt;: So they said that you couldn‚Äôt have this paid-for licence.  Do you have any idea what the licences cost?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Alex Hewson (18:06)&lt;/strong&gt;: Other people have suggested values to me.  And what‚Äôs been suggested to me is that if you tell them you‚Äôre building a website you get offered a very cheap licence, something that you can work with, something that‚Äôs pocket money.  But if you suggest to them that you‚Äôre building an application for a phone or a website that presents the data to a phone then they become very steep indeed, and of course if you‚Äôre doing this as a project that‚Äôs free, well then you can‚Äôt really do it anymore.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Winifred Robinson (18:30)&lt;/strong&gt;: Now as I understand it, you did want to take this application, this app that you had invented, and make some money from it, and you did go to them and ask them if you could have a licence, but they‚Äôve said no, that you‚Äôre not to have one.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Alex Hewson (18:42)&lt;/strong&gt;: Well that‚Äôs right.  About a year ago, soon after I built the free web application, I had an idea for a downloadable app that would run on Android phones.  I‚Äôd have to pay someone else to write that so it was going to have to be a sold application.  So I wrote them a letter asking if I could have a licence.  It seemed reasonable that if I was making some money off it then they should have some.  I got a response saying, ‚Äúno way, the data is never for commercial use, it‚Äôs not to be commercially used at all‚Äù.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Winifred Robinson (19:06)&lt;/strong&gt;: They still stick with the idea that you can‚Äôt have a licence, why?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Alex Hewson (19:10)&lt;/strong&gt;: That‚Äôs right.  Because I was critical of them.  I wrote these blog posts where, I think, I quoted three lines of an email from one of their staff.  I think they were quite aggrieved by it.  I mean, I got this email from their Chief Executive telling me off for doing so.  A month after I applied for the licence, you know, I‚Äôd heard nothing from them.  I wrote again, saying, ‚Äúcan I have a licence‚Äù and they said, ‚Äúno, no you can‚Äôt have a licence because you made these comments critical of us‚Äù.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Winifred Robinson (19:34)&lt;/strong&gt;: So what are you going to do?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Alex Hewson (19:36)&lt;/strong&gt;: Well, what I‚Äôve done is appealed, and it turns out that I can write to the chief executive of national rail enquiries.  So, I‚Äôve done that but of course, I‚Äôm not very hopeful because he‚Äôs the same man who told me off for quoting his staff‚Äôs emails.  At any rate, he‚Äôs obliged to give a response to this appeal, in writing.  I sent that a month ago, it got to him on the sixth of December.  I‚Äôve had nothing back yet.  I‚Äôm very curious to see what he says.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Winifred Robinson (20:00)&lt;/strong&gt;: Alex Hewson.  Well National Rail Enquiries is run by ATOC, the Association of Train Operating Companies, and Edward Welsh speaks for them.  Edward Welsh, it‚Äôs probably fair to say isn‚Äôt it, that some of these applications appeared before anyone, including you, knew the potential of them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Edward Welsh (20:15)&lt;/strong&gt;: Well, let me explain how this system works.  I mean, there were a couple of inaccuracies in what that report was saying.  I mean, first of all, this information is a data feed that is effectively like the wholesale provision of information to retailers, if you like, and the Network Rail Enquiries website is like the shop front.  It‚Äôs like the retail outlet, and the apps are the same things.  So, actually, the data feed itself, is not publicly available information.  It is correct that we have expected people to seek a licence and abide by our terms and conditions for four or five years now and we were assuming bona fide users of that information were applying for licences, and many organisations did.  Some of them got the licences granted free as well.  It just so happened that last year we realised that people were effectively using this information without agreeing to the terms and conditions, without seeking a licence, and so we put a password on it in November and that meant that various people who had been using it without seeking a licence, without agreeing to the terms and conditions, had to come to us for a password.  Now, around a dozen organisations came to us, one of them was Mr Hewson, and it‚Äôs a great pity because it didn‚Äôt have to finish, it didn‚Äôt have to end up like this.  None of those organisations who were in the same boat as Mr Hewson, i.e. somebody who hadn‚Äôt got a licence and was using the information without agreeing to the terms and conditions, we had highly successful discussions with them, they have got licences, they are using/have access to the data/information. They have the password and some of them are/have effectively got that for free.  What happened in the case of Mr Hewson was that, yeah, he did write this on the blog and I have to say that when you‚Äôre opening up discussions with another organisation, or another person, you‚Äôre trying to build up a relationship of trust and I think, whether you‚Äôre a commercial organisation or not, you would find it slightly off-putting, it would colour your view, of somebody else if they put private email exchanges up into the public domain during those discussions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Winifred Robinson (22:18)&lt;/strong&gt;: Well, let‚Äôs leave him aside for one moment, because we‚Äôve got limited time here.  The argument against charging for this raw data and trying to control who uses it to develop these applications is that you are not a private company like any other.  Your business is heavily subsidised by the tax payer and in that sense, this information belongs to us, and not to you.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Edward Welsh (22:36)&lt;/strong&gt;: Well, let‚Äôs get two things clear here.  First of all NRE is a limited company.  The shareholders are the train companies and it doesn‚Äôt make a profit.  Train companies, many of them pay money, net contributions to the government.  Some of them receive money from the government to run services.  Overall, train companies receive about three hun.. net subsidies around six hundred million pounds a year.  That‚Äôs one fifth of the total cost of running the railways.  Secondly, the data feed is not free.  Somebody has to pay for it.  We don‚Äôt believe tax payers who subsidise the railway, or passengers who pay to get on trains should have to pay for apps to have this information for free.  Now Transport for London, I believe‚Ä¶&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Winifred Robinson (23:20)&lt;/strong&gt;: But you‚Äôd never think of these brilliant apps, would you?  You‚Äôve had years to do it, you‚Äôve never come up with them.  These are people with a special kind of mind and they think of this stuff and they do it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Edward Welsh (23:27)&lt;/strong&gt;: Well, and that‚Äôs exactly what is going on, I mean, I just talked to my colleague in NRE and he told me we‚Äôve granted around a dozen licences in the last two to three weeks.  Half of those are to small, independent entrepreneurs.  The original iPhone app, which is one of the most successful apps on the market, was thought up by a one man band, who came to us, has a licence and was granted a licence.  It‚Äôs not blocking innovation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Winifred Robinson (23.50)&lt;/strong&gt;: Well, Edward Welsh, I have to leave it there because we have another guest with us, David Rowan, the editor of Wired magazine.  Just to give us an idea, if you would before we go, of the potential for using this information.  Transport for London decided to offer all its raw data to these web developers free.  Tell us what they have managed to do with it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;David Rowan (24:06)&lt;/strong&gt;: Well, I think National Rail Enquiries is a dinosaur that‚Äôs scandalously working against the public interest because the great thing about developers is, they invent things that organisations like that won‚Äôt.  Transport for London released its data feeds.  Coders, developers, like Matthew Somerville created a real time map of where individual underground trains are.  It‚Äôs like a google map with these little moving icons.  They wouldn‚Äôt have thought about that.  I‚Äôm a tax payer, I‚Äôm also a passenger. I want the generosity of the developers to help me do my journey more efficiently.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Winifred Robinson (24:37)&lt;/strong&gt;: I mentioned that Gordon Brown strongly thinks this information should always be supplied free.  What does David Cameron think?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;David Rowan (24:42)&lt;/strong&gt;: David Cameron, thank goodness, is backing open data because he understands that if you put raw data out there, developers, creative designers can turn it into information that the public can use.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Winifred Robinson (24:54)&lt;/strong&gt;: David Rowan, thank you very much.  That‚Äôs it for today‚Ä¶&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Day notes - Tue 11th Jan 2011</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://jamesmead.org/&quot;&gt;James M&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;http://interblah.net/&quot;&gt;James A&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;http://jasoncale.com/&quot;&gt;Jase&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;http://tomafro.net/&quot;&gt;Tom&lt;/a&gt; and I spent the day working from the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.o2.co.uk/&quot;&gt;O2&lt;/a&gt; offices in Slough.  We managed to do a little development but the main purpose was to discuss the future of &lt;a href=&quot;https://hashblue.com/&quot;&gt;#blue&lt;/a&gt;.  We chatted legal, API, SMS, MMS and about potential feature ideas for the site itself.  Our hope at the moment is that we‚Äôll have &lt;a href=&quot;http://blog.hashblue.com/post/2639180365/message-backup-progress&quot;&gt;automatic message copy back up and running by the end of February&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I listened to the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.bbc.co.uk/radio4/features/you-and-yours/&quot;&gt;You and Yours&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/p00d4n2l&quot;&gt;segment about National Rail Enquiries live departure board API&lt;/a&gt;.  As an aside, it‚Äôs a shame that the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.bbc.co.uk/radio4/youandyours/transcripts_index.shtml&quot;&gt;You and Yours transcripts&lt;/a&gt; aren‚Äôt kept up to date as you‚Äôd be able to continue reading the interview after the show disappears from iPlayer (at least, I assume it‚Äôll disappear).  I‚Äôm kinda interested in National Rail‚Äôs approach as they‚Äôve previously &lt;a href=&quot;http://chrisroos.co.uk/blog/2009-01-31-turning-off-my-national-rail-twitter-bot&quot;&gt;asked me to disable my national rail twitter bot&lt;/a&gt; and I know others have had similar problems (&lt;a href=&quot;http://mocko.org.uk/b/2010/10/29/national-rail-have-killed-my-train-times-app/&quot;&gt;Alex Hewson‚Äôs case&lt;/a&gt; is covered in the You and Yours programme).  I think their approach just smacks of old school business think - ‚ÄúWe control the supply of the data.  People want our data.  Let‚Äôs monetise the shit of THE DATA.  Muhahahaha.  Oh, and don‚Äôt say bad things about us because we‚Äôll sulk and take our toys (sorry, data) away from you‚Äù.  Err, that was a bit of a childish rant.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Day notes - Mon 10th Jan 2011</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://kalv.co.uk/&quot;&gt;Kalv&lt;/a&gt; and I spent a good few hours trying to work out why &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.openswan.org/&quot;&gt;Openswan&lt;/a&gt; wasn‚Äôt starting when one of our Ubuntu servers rebooted.  We eventually came across two bugs in the Ubuntu openswan package that were causing us problems.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The first, &lt;a href=&quot;https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/openswan/+bug/554592&quot;&gt;bug 554592&lt;/a&gt;, appears to be due to the openswan package mis-configuring the runlevels for the ipsec script (at least that‚Äôs my understanding).  The effect is that the process doesn‚Äôt close down cleanly on a reboot and is therefore unable to start again.  As the bug report states, you can either run &lt;code&gt;ipsec restart&lt;/code&gt; after boot or more permanently modify the runlevels.  We‚Äôve chosen to update our puppet scripts to modify the runlevels.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The second, &lt;a href=&quot;https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/openswan/+bug/526452&quot;&gt;bug 526452&lt;/a&gt;, appears to be due to a bug in the _realsetup script.  It expects the /var/lock/subsys directory to exist and ends up reporting confusing information if it doesn‚Äôt.  We‚Äôve fixed this by modifying our puppet script, which in turn modifies the ipsec script, to ensure this directory exists.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It was pretty windy on the cycle home tonight.  I struggled at times with my bike as it is currently.  That should be fun with the new chainring on.&lt;/p&gt;

        <description>&lt;p&gt;Bought and watched the incredible &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.firstascentseries.com/&quot;&gt;First Ascent series&lt;/a&gt;.  All six episodes contain inspirational stories and amazing footage.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I ordered a &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.chainreactioncycles.com/Models.aspx?ModelID=47443&quot;&gt;50t chainring&lt;/a&gt; to pop on my new bike.  I‚Äôm slightly concerned that this‚Äôll make it a bit too hard to ride but I‚Äôll just have to wait to find out.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Day notes - Fri 7th Jan 2011</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;We spent some more time this morning discussing work for the first part of this year.  We even managed to come to a descision which felt great.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I continued to work with both &lt;a href=&quot;http://kalv.co.uk/&quot;&gt;Kalv&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;http://interblah.net/&quot;&gt;James A&lt;/a&gt; to get our servers provisioned using &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.puppetlabs.com/&quot;&gt;Puppet&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Day notes - Thu 6th Jan 2011</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;My first cycle to work today.  I bought a &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.marin.co.uk/2011/bikepage.php?ModNo=11IN&quot;&gt;Marin Inverness&lt;/a&gt; just before Christmas but today was the first chance I had to cycle it into the office.  I got soaked.  Like water squelching out of my trainers soaked.  I need to work on some wet weather clobber before I cycle in the rain again.  I need to change the gearing on the bike too - it‚Äôs nice and easy to get started but I hit top speed way too soon.  I‚Äôll either definitely do this or just never ride the bike again.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Work wise, I spent some time working with &lt;a href=&quot;http://kalv.co.uk/&quot;&gt;Kalv&lt;/a&gt; on getting another of our servers provisioned using &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.puppetlabs.com/&quot;&gt;puppet&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

We‚Äôre going to spend at least a day a week there in future but this was more of a New Year catchup.  We got confirmation on a couple of dates and heard about some of the newer ideas O2 have got for &lt;a href=&quot;https://hashblue.com/&quot;&gt;hashblue&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The downside of the meeting was that I had to endure some rush hour train and tubeage.  Nasty.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Day notes - Tue 4th Jan 2011</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;We, &lt;a href=&quot;http://gofreerange.com&quot;&gt;Go Free Range&lt;/a&gt;, moved today.  We‚Äôve spent the last 6 months or so with &lt;a href=&quot;http://uk.moo.com/&quot;&gt;Moo&lt;/a&gt;, which has been great, but decided to take &lt;a href=&quot;http://prote.in/&quot;&gt;Protein‚Äôs&lt;/a&gt; offer of our own room in their &lt;a href=&quot;http://gofreerange.com/#contact&quot;&gt;Hewett Street&lt;/a&gt; building.  It turns out we travel pretty light so it took all of about two hours to get moved and settled in.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Once in, we attempted to get a handle on our work committments for the first part of this year.  Then we went for a pub lunch.  We deserved it.  Probably.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://interblah.net/&quot;&gt;James A&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;http://jamesmead.org/&quot;&gt;James M&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;http://jasoncale.com/&quot;&gt;Jase&lt;/a&gt; and I finished the day supping coffee and chatting with a chap about some potential future work.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Working out what we can and can‚Äôt commit to is complicated slightly by our commitments to the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.o2.co.uk/&quot;&gt;O2&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://hashblue.com/&quot;&gt;hashblue&lt;/a&gt; project.  We‚Äôre meeting O2 tomorrow so should hopefully have a better idea after that.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Day notes - Mon 3rd Jan 2011</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;Happy New Year everybody peeps.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I started this little day notes thingy in October last year, did it for a bit, got behind and then gave up.  I‚Äôm going to start again and see if I can keep it up this year (I almost certainly won‚Äôt).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We, at &lt;a href=&quot;http://gofreerange.com&quot;&gt;Go Free Range&lt;/a&gt;, essentially took a couple of weeks off over Christmas.  It was good.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Anyway, that‚Äôs enough about last year.  I want to try to do more physical stuff this year.  To that end I‚Äôve entered the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.newhamlondonrun.org/Events/Newham/Default.aspx&quot;&gt;Newham London 10k&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.greatswim.org/Events/British-Gas-Great-East-Swim/AboutThe2Miles.aspx&quot;&gt;2 mile Great East swim&lt;/a&gt;.  I‚Äôm also very tempted by the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.snowdoniaslateman.com/&quot;&gt;Snowdonia Slateman Triathlon&lt;/a&gt;, I‚Äôm hopefully going to do the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.thethreepeakschallenge.co.uk/&quot;&gt;National Three Peaks Challenge&lt;/a&gt; with &lt;a href=&quot;http://danielsiddle.co.uk/&quot;&gt;Sid&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;http://jasoncale.com/&quot;&gt;Jase&lt;/a&gt; has talked about some big bike ride in Italy or summit.  Oh, and I did start (I saw a trainer &lt;em&gt;once&lt;/em&gt;) ‚Äòtraining‚Äô for a Channel swim.  I‚Äôm not sure what to do about that yet‚Ä¶&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Day notes - Thu 18th Nov 2010</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;I‚Äôve got this idea about explaining iterative software development using the analogy of bridging a gap to get to something you can see on the other side.  I did some reading around this to see if other people had already written similar things.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://kalv.co.uk/&quot;&gt;Kalv&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;http://interblah.net/&quot;&gt;James A&lt;/a&gt; and I had a great meeting with a business that were enquiring about re-writing the software they use daily.  It was great because it reminded me that we all share a common view of software development and the desire to ‚Äúdo the right thing‚Äù.  On questioning their motivation for wanting to re-write the existing system it became clear that their problems lie with the maintenance of the software rather than the software itself.  We basically talked ourselves out of the work by suggesting that they contract a small Java shop (the current software is written in Java) to maintain and enhance the existing system rather than to go with a re-write (I‚Äôm actually not convinced that a re-write is ever the answer).  We got in touch with a few Java shops and made the introductions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Caught up on these day notes &lt;em&gt;again&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

        <description>&lt;p&gt;Invoicing with &lt;a href=&quot;http://kalv.co.uk/&quot;&gt;Kalv&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://interblah.net/&quot;&gt;James A&lt;/a&gt; and I had a play with &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.rapidtask.com/&quot;&gt;Rapid Task&lt;/a&gt; from the Google Apps marketplace.  I was after a simple group todo list.  Although this was quite nice it didn‚Äôt do exactly what we were after so we discarded it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Looked at some office space that would give us our own place.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Finished a little refactoring/tidying task on &lt;a href=&quot;https://hashblue.com/&quot;&gt;#blue&lt;/a&gt; with &lt;a href=&quot;http://interblah.net/&quot;&gt;James A&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Switched from &lt;a href=&quot;http://campfirenow.com/&quot;&gt;Campfire&lt;/a&gt; to our own homegrown ‚Äòchat‚Äô app for internal use.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://blog.hashblue.com/post/1601203270/blue-and-bluebook-part-2&quot;&gt;Blogged about&lt;/a&gt; the unfortunate news that some of the &lt;a href=&quot;https://hashblue.com/&quot;&gt;#blue&lt;/a&gt;/&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.o2.co.uk/&quot;&gt;o2&lt;/a&gt; integration is going to have to wait until the New Year.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Day notes - Tue 16th Nov 2010</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://kalv.co.uk/&quot;&gt;Kalv&lt;/a&gt; and I continued to work on changing our &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.puppetlabs.com/&quot;&gt;puppet&lt;/a&gt;/&lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/capistrano/capistrano/wiki/Documentation-v2.x&quot;&gt;capistrano&lt;/a&gt; recipes so that we could deploy as a single user.  This ended up taking quite a while to do.  We already had a ‚Äòfreerange::user‚Äô definition that would create a user and set their SSH key but this wouldn‚Äôt allow us to create a single user with multiple keys.  We ended up splitting the user creation from the SSH key assignment which allowed us to continue to create our individual user accounts and to create a generic user that all of us could log in as.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We fixed some other problems with our puppet deploy scripts that we came across (e.g. &lt;a href=&quot;http://mmonit.com/monit/&quot;&gt;monit&lt;/a&gt; wasn‚Äôt being started and our users were set to use /bin/sh rather than something a little more advanced).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We fixed a problem where we were incorrectly using the newer version of the &lt;a href=&quot;http://rubygems.org/gems/tinder&quot;&gt;Tinder gem&lt;/a&gt; to broadcast builds and deploys.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Had a conference call with &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.o2.co.uk/&quot;&gt;o2&lt;/a&gt; where we got some slightly &lt;a href=&quot;http://blog.hashblue.com/post/1601203270/blue-and-bluebook-part-2&quot;&gt;disappointing news&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Day notes - Mon 15th Nov 2010</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;Paired with &lt;a href=&quot;http://kalv.co.uk/&quot;&gt;Kalv&lt;/a&gt; to sign off some outstanding &lt;a href=&quot;https://hashblue.com/&quot;&gt;#blue&lt;/a&gt; stories in &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.pivotaltracker.com&quot;&gt;Pivotal Tracker&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We noticed that viewing a ‚Äòmissing resource‚Äô was raising an exception and returning a 500 http response.  It should, and now does, return a 404 response.  &lt;a href=&quot;http://rubyonrails.org/&quot;&gt;Rails&lt;/a&gt;/&lt;a href=&quot;http://ar.rubyonrails.org/&quot;&gt;ActiveRecord&lt;/a&gt; would normally take care of this by raising, and correctly rescuing from, an ActiveRecord::RecordNotFound exception but we were using a custom find method that didn‚Äôt replicate this behaviour.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We noticed that we couldn‚Äôt actually deploy to our newly provisioned staging server as our own users (this was originally a requirement from &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.o2.co.uk/&quot;&gt;o2&lt;/a&gt; for deploying to the &lt;a href=&quot;http://aws.amazon.com/&quot;&gt;AWS&lt;/a&gt; servers).  We decided to respect &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/capistrano/capistrano/wiki/Documentation-v2.x&quot;&gt;Capistrano‚Äôs&lt;/a&gt; wishes and work out how to get it to deploy as a single user.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We all spent about 90 minutes on a ‚Äò&lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Retrospective&quot;&gt;retrospective&lt;/a&gt;‚Äô (quotes because I‚Äôm not sure it was technically a retrospective) focussing on &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pair_programming&quot;&gt;pairing&lt;/a&gt;.  Although there were specific examples of when it was/wasn‚Äôt working we decided not to change anything and just to monitor the situation this week so that we could work out whether we wanted to change anything next week.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Watched &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1285016/&quot;&gt;The Social Network&lt;/a&gt; at &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.picturehouses.co.uk/cinema/Ritzy_Picturehouse/&quot;&gt;Brixton‚Äôs ritzy cinema&lt;/a&gt;.  I can best describe it as ‚Äúa film I‚Äôve seen‚Äù.&lt;/p&gt;

        <description>&lt;p&gt;Travelled back to London with &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.eliotfineberg.com/&quot;&gt;Eliot&lt;/a&gt; and found a great little pub called the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.beerintheevening.com/pubs/s/25/25891/Gladstone_Arms/Borough&quot;&gt;Gladstone&lt;/a&gt; with some live music.&lt;/p&gt;

        <description>&lt;p&gt;Spent the morning at &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.interestingnorth.com/&quot;&gt;Interesting North&lt;/a&gt; with &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.eliotfineberg.com/&quot;&gt;Eliot&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;http://twitter.com/serenamchugh&quot;&gt;Serena&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Started the afternoon by watching England smash Australia and followed it up by visiting various pubs around Sheffield.&lt;/p&gt;

        <description>&lt;p&gt;I had the day off today to travel up to Sheffield with &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.eliotfineberg.com/&quot;&gt;Eliot&lt;/a&gt; for &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.interestingnorth.com/&quot;&gt;Interesting North&lt;/a&gt; tomorrow.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I finally managed to order a bed this morning after sleeping on an airbed for the last few months.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Day notes - Thu 11th Nov 2010</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;Continued pairing with &lt;a href=&quot;http://interblah.net/&quot;&gt;James A&lt;/a&gt; to get our staging server provisioned with &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.puppetlabs.com/&quot;&gt;Puppet&lt;/a&gt;.  We‚Äôd previously spent quite a while setting up puppet to provision our application servers as &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.centos.org/&quot;&gt;CentOS&lt;/a&gt; on &lt;a href=&quot;http://aws.amazon.com/&quot;&gt;AWS&lt;/a&gt;.  The work to migrate &lt;a href=&quot;https://hashblue.com/&quot;&gt;#blue&lt;/a&gt; to AWS was put on hold yet we didn‚Äôt want to lose our investment in puppet so we decided to make the relevant changes so that we could use &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/freerange/freerange-puppet&quot;&gt;our scripts&lt;/a&gt; to provision our &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.ubuntu.com/&quot;&gt;ubuntu&lt;/a&gt; staging server.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Paired with &lt;a href=&quot;http://blog.floehopper.org/&quot;&gt;James M&lt;/a&gt; to fix the non-deterministic asynchronous javascript &lt;a href=&quot;http://docs.jquery.com/Qunit&quot;&gt;qunit&lt;/a&gt; tests that &lt;a href=&quot;http://jasoncale.com/&quot;&gt;Jase&lt;/a&gt; and I looked at on Monday.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Paired with &lt;a href=&quot;http://interblah.net/&quot;&gt;James A&lt;/a&gt; on getting us using &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.puppetlabs.com/&quot;&gt;Puppet&lt;/a&gt; to provision our &lt;a href=&quot;https://hashblue.com/&quot;&gt;#blue&lt;/a&gt; staging server.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Day notes - Tue 9th Nov 2010</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;Spent the day remote pairing with &lt;a href=&quot;http://jasoncale.com/&quot;&gt;Jase&lt;/a&gt; (he was already over in Belfast for &lt;a href=&quot;http://buildconf.com/&quot;&gt;Build conference&lt;/a&gt;) on &lt;a href=&quot;http://cm.buildconf.com/&quot;&gt;Caffeine Monitor&lt;/a&gt;.  The original markup had been designed for a fixed resolution but it became clear (to be fair it probably should‚Äôve become clear more than one day before the conference) that we‚Äôd need to support more than just the one resolution.  We had to redo some of the markup and css and Jase added some &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.w3.org/TR/css3-mediaqueries/&quot;&gt;media queries&lt;/a&gt; to ensure that it looked OK on smaller screens too.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Day notes - Mon 8th Nov 2010</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;Worked with &lt;a href=&quot;http://jasoncale.com/&quot;&gt;Jase&lt;/a&gt; on some crazy failing tests in &lt;a href=&quot;https://hashblue.com/&quot;&gt;#blue&lt;/a&gt;.  We think we narrowed the problem down to testing asynchronous javascript with &lt;a href=&quot;http://docs.jquery.com/Qunit&quot;&gt;qunit&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A little &lt;a href=&quot;http://cm.buildconf.com/&quot;&gt;Caffeine Monitor&lt;/a&gt; tidying before the &lt;a href=&quot;http://buildconf.com/&quot;&gt;Build conference&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Watched &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peter_Kay&quot;&gt;Peter Kay&lt;/a&gt; at the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.theo2.co.uk/&quot;&gt;O2&lt;/a&gt;.  T‚Äôwas very good indeed.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Day notes - Fri 5th Nov 2010</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;Started out tidying up the code I was using to illustrate a problem with &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/smparkes/env-js&quot;&gt;envjs&lt;/a&gt; so that I could use it to raise a &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/smparkes/env-js/issues/issue/23&quot;&gt;ticket&lt;/a&gt; and as another reason to discuss &lt;a href=&quot;http://groups.google.com/group/envjs/browse_thread/thread/ec2ba83d0fb3e57c&quot;&gt;bringing the johnson fork back inline with the main branch&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I created a simple &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/chrisroos/capybara-data-method-naughtiness&quot;&gt;project&lt;/a&gt; to expose one of the problems I see with Capybara knowing about Rails 3 specific behaviour in its rack_test driver.  I &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/jnicklas/capybara/issues/184&quot;&gt;raised a ticket too&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Spent about an hour working with &lt;a href=&quot;http://kalv.co.uk/&quot;&gt;Kalv&lt;/a&gt; to create an &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/freerange/docalerts&quot;&gt;app that exposes atom feeds from Google Docs&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

        <description>&lt;p&gt;Caught up on my outstanding ‚Äòday notes‚Äô.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Spent quite a long time trying to get a &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/chrisroos/capybara-envjs-rack-test&quot;&gt;failing test&lt;/a&gt; to expose the strange &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/smparkes/env-js&quot;&gt;envjs&lt;/a&gt; problem that &lt;a href=&quot;http://jasoncale.com/&quot;&gt;Jase&lt;/a&gt; and I were seeing last week.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Pretty much finished up the ‚Äòproject for upcoming conference‚Äô work with &lt;a href=&quot;http://interblah.net/&quot;&gt;James A&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;http://jasoncale.com/&quot;&gt;Jase&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Day notes - Wed 27th Oct 2010</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;Paired with &lt;a href=&quot;http://kalv.co.uk/&quot;&gt;Kalv&lt;/a&gt; to investigate some problems with &lt;a href=&quot;https://hashblue.com/&quot;&gt;#blue&lt;/a&gt; where certain bits of the site didn‚Äôt work without Javascript, even though we thought we had tests for exactly the case where javascript &lt;em&gt;was&lt;/em&gt; disabled.  It turns out that Capybara does some evilness in &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/jnicklas/capybara/commit/58d4d0caf7d4fad5519033e9bfd0786146750a13&quot;&gt;simulating javascript behaviour&lt;/a&gt; when it detects special &lt;a href=&quot;http://dev.w3.org/html5/spec/elements.html#embedding-custom-non-visible-data-with-the-data-attributes&quot;&gt;data-* attributes&lt;/a&gt; that &lt;a href=&quot;http://rubyonrails.org/&quot;&gt;Rails&lt;/a&gt; emits.  Kalv‚Äôs written more in &lt;a href=&quot;http://kalv.co.uk/2010/10/27/stop-being-clever-capybara/&quot;&gt;Stop being clever Capybara&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Day notes - Sat 23rd Oct 2010</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;Spent the day on &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.theoriginaltour.com/&quot;&gt;The Original Tour&lt;/a&gt; buses in London with Mum and Dad for Dad‚Äôs birthday.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Spent the evening in the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.brazenmonkey.co.uk/&quot;&gt;Brazen Monkey&lt;/a&gt; celebrating &lt;a href=&quot;http://kalv.co.uk/&quot;&gt;Kalv‚Äôs&lt;/a&gt; 30th.  I popped my karaoke cherry singing Smells like teen spirit with &lt;a href=&quot;http://tomafro.net/&quot;&gt;Tom&lt;/a&gt;.  I‚Äôm pretty certain we sounded exactly like &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TBQ7jcEh2Qs&quot;&gt;Kurt singing on Top of the Pops&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Day notes - Fri 22nd Oct 2010</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;Continued investigating the &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/smparkes/capybara-envjs&quot;&gt;capybara-envjs&lt;/a&gt; error we ran into yesterday.  I got a simple failing test but need to simplify further before it can be submitted as an issue.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Worked with &lt;a href=&quot;http://jasoncale.com/&quot;&gt;Jase&lt;/a&gt; on a project we‚Äôre working on for an upcoming conference.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Finished reading &lt;a href=&quot;http://books.google.co.uk/books?id=QaM-AgAACAAJ&quot;&gt;Call of the wild&lt;/a&gt;.  I‚Äôd recommend it.  It‚Äôs named after the &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jack_London&quot;&gt;Jack London&lt;/a&gt; book of the same name (mentioned in one of my favourite books/films, &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0758758/&quot;&gt;Into the wild&lt;/a&gt;) which happens to be available on &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.apple.com/education/itunes-u/&quot;&gt;iTunes U&lt;/a&gt;.  &lt;a href=&quot;http://itunes.apple.com/itunes-u/call-of-the-wild/id384518080&quot;&gt;Call of the Wild on iTunes U&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

        <description>&lt;p&gt;Tested/confirmed connectivity with an &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Short_message_service_center&quot;&gt;SMSC&lt;/a&gt; at &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.o2.co.uk/&quot;&gt;O2&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ran into a strange &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/smparkes/capybara-envjs&quot;&gt;capybara-envjs&lt;/a&gt; problem with &lt;a href=&quot;http://jasoncale.com/&quot;&gt;Jase&lt;/a&gt;.  The error occurs somewhere deep within the event loop of envjs.&lt;/p&gt;

        <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://kalv.co.uk/&quot;&gt;Kalv&lt;/a&gt; and I created a really simple project tracking tool thingy in &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.google.com/google-d-s/spreadsheets/&quot;&gt;Google Spreadsheets&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Used Google‚Äôs &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.google.com/google-d-s/drawings/&quot;&gt;drawing tool&lt;/a&gt; to create some diagrams.  It‚Äôs a pretty darn neat little tool.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Went to/got drunk at the New Act Night at the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.comedycafe.co.uk/&quot;&gt;Comedy cafe&lt;/a&gt;.  It‚Äôs free.  It was good.  You should go.&lt;/p&gt;

        <description>&lt;p&gt;Started using &lt;a href=&quot;http://agilewebsolutions.com/products/1Password&quot;&gt;1password&lt;/a&gt; to see whether it could replace my &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.gnupg.org/&quot;&gt;gpg&lt;/a&gt; encrypted text files (on &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dropbox.com/&quot;&gt;dropbox&lt;/a&gt;) that I use to store passwords and the like.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Moved my Chrome Bookmarks to &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.google.com/bookmarks&quot;&gt;Google Bookmarks&lt;/a&gt;.  I‚Äôm using the &lt;a href=&quot;https://chrome.google.com/extensions/detail/jdnejaepfmacfdmhkplckpfdcjgbeode&quot;&gt;Yet Another Google Bookmarks Extension&lt;/a&gt; to integrate these bookmarks with Chrome.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Day notes - Tue 26th Oct 2010</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;Paired with &lt;a href=&quot;http://jasoncale.com/&quot;&gt;Jase&lt;/a&gt; on multiple minor problems we found in &lt;a href=&quot;http://hashblue.com&quot;&gt;hashblue&lt;/a&gt;.  We‚Äôve decided to fix bugs as we come across them rather than logging them in &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.pivotaltracker.com/&quot;&gt;Pivotal Tracker&lt;/a&gt;, and we found a few recently while working on another story.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We discovered that &lt;a href=&quot;http://api.rubyonrails.org/classes/ActionController/TemplateAssertions.html#method-i-assert_template&quot;&gt;assert_template&lt;/a&gt; is slightly more screwed than we‚Äôd realised.  It turns out that even if checking for a partial with a layout did work, it still wouldn‚Äôt do what you‚Äôd expect: it‚Äôd &lt;em&gt;only&lt;/em&gt; check for the layout.  We amended our &lt;a href=&quot;http://github.com/freerange/action_controller_template_assertions_ticket_5247&quot;&gt;assert_template patch&lt;/a&gt; to emit a warning if you do try to use assert_template with the :partial and :layout options.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I started reading the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.amazon.co.uk/Hardcore-Zen-Monster-Movies-Reality/dp/086171380X&quot;&gt;Hardcore Zen&lt;/a&gt; book.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Day notes - Mon 25th Oct 2010</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;Resumed an investigation into an &lt;a href=&quot;http://github.com/smparkes/env-js&quot;&gt;envjs&lt;/a&gt; problem that &lt;a href=&quot;http://jasoncale.com/&quot;&gt;Jase&lt;/a&gt; and I start on Friday.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ripped out a whole load of javascript functionality from &lt;a href=&quot;http://hashblue.com&quot;&gt;hashblue&lt;/a&gt; which meant we no longer ran into the envjs problem.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We noticed that we were incorrectly returning html with a content-type of text/javascript (through our use of respond_to and wants.js).  Fixing this actually fixed another problem we‚Äôd been seeing in &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.google.com/chrome&quot;&gt;Chrome&lt;/a&gt;.  It seems that something deep within &lt;a href=&quot;http://jquery.com/&quot;&gt;jquery&lt;/a&gt; was trying to parse the html as javascript and raising this exception: ‚ÄúUncaught SyntaxError: Unexpected token &amp;lt;‚Äù.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We ran into ran into the problem described in &lt;a href=&quot;https://rails.lighthouseapp.com/projects/8994/tickets/5247-assert_template-wrong-behavior-for-testing-layout-used-to-render-template&quot;&gt;Rails lighthouse ticket 5247&lt;/a&gt;.  We wanted to use the broken behaviour so created the &lt;a href=&quot;http://github.com/freerange/action_controller_template_assertions_ticket_5247&quot;&gt;action_controller_template_assertions_ticket_5247&lt;/a&gt; gem to monkey patch the broken method.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Day notes - Fri 15th Oct 2010</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;I hijacked &lt;a href=&quot;http://jasoncale.com/&quot;&gt;Jase&lt;/a&gt; to help tidy up this site.  It was really quite bad, see &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.flickr.com/photos/chrisjroos/5085423101/&quot;&gt;before&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.flickr.com/photos/chrisjroos/5086019350/&quot;&gt;after&lt;/a&gt;.  It previously used the reset, grids and fonts &lt;a href=&quot;http://developer.yahoo.com/yui/&quot;&gt;YUI&lt;/a&gt; stylesheets with some crappy hand-crafted CSS on top.  Jase ripped all of that out, started with a basic reset stylesheet and built it back up from there.  I like it.  Thanks Jase.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I spent a little time working with &lt;a href=&quot;http://interblah.net/&quot;&gt;James A&lt;/a&gt; on some work he was doing with &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.w3.org/TR/offline-webapps/&quot;&gt;offline web apps&lt;/a&gt;.  After manually generating the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.w3.org/TR/offline-webapps/#offline&quot;&gt;offline Manifest&lt;/a&gt; and running into the pretty much all the problems described in &lt;a href=&quot;http://diveintomark.org/&quot;&gt;Mark Pilgrim‚Äôs&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;http://diveintohtml5.org/offline.html#debugging&quot;&gt;Dive into HTML 5&lt;/a&gt; we turned to &lt;a href=&quot;http://github.com/wycats/rack-offline&quot;&gt;Rack offline&lt;/a&gt;.  This worked great out of the box but we really struggled to customise the default behaviour.  We didn‚Äôt spend too long and it was getting late on Friday afternoon so there‚Äôs a chance we were doing something stoopid here.&lt;/p&gt;

We satisfied ourselves that we understood the data coming out of JMeter and that we could repeat our ‚Äòtests‚Äô before writing up fairly detailed instructions so that someone else could sign off the story we were working on.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Day notes - Mon 18th Oct 2010</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;Started using a shared &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Keychain_\(Mac_OS\)&quot;&gt;keychain&lt;/a&gt; file (stored in shared &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dropbox.com/&quot;&gt;dropbox&lt;/a&gt; instead of a password protected dmg containing a text file full of passwords.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Worked with &lt;a href=&quot;http://tomafro.net/&quot;&gt;Tom&lt;/a&gt; to start migrating the hosting of an app from &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.linode.com/&quot;&gt;linode&lt;/a&gt; to &lt;a href=&quot;http://aws.amazon.com/&quot;&gt;AWS&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;O2 meeting with &lt;a href=&quot;http://kalv.co.uk/&quot;&gt;Kalv&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Worked with &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.interblah.net/&quot;&gt;James A&lt;/a&gt; to get a performance testing story accepted.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Played around with the security command line tool to extract a private key from a secure note in the keychain.  You‚Äôll need something like this if you want to do the same.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;  $ security find-generic-password -g -l &quot;my-label&quot; 2&amp;gt;&amp;amp;1 1&amp;gt;/dev/null | ruby -e &#39;puts STDIN.read[/-----BEGIN PRIVATE KEY-----.*-----END PRIVATE KEY-----/].gsub(/\\012/, &quot;\n&quot;)&#39; &amp;gt; ~/path-to-key

    &lt;p&gt;Weekly meeting with O2.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;The second team retrospective run by &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.techbelly.com/&quot;&gt;Ben G&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Worked with &lt;a href=&quot;http://kalv.co.uk/&quot;&gt;Kalv&lt;/a&gt; to see whether we could get any useful data out of &lt;a href=&quot;http://jakarta.apache.org/jmeter/&quot;&gt;JMeter&lt;/a&gt; after our (&lt;a href=&quot;http://blog.floehopper.org/&quot;&gt;James M&lt;/a&gt; and I) somewhat unsuccessful attempts at getting anything useful &lt;a href=&quot;http://tsung.erlang-projects.org/&quot;&gt;tsung&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.hpl.hp.com/research/linux/httperf/&quot;&gt;httperf&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.joedog.org/index/siege-home&quot;&gt;siege&lt;/a&gt;.  Initial results appear positive, at least in the sense that we can actually get useful data.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Day notes - Tues 12th Oct 2010</title>
        <description>&lt;h2&gt;Work stuff&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://blog.floehopper.org/&quot;&gt;James M&lt;/a&gt; and I continued working with &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.hpl.hp.com/research/linux/httperf/&quot;&gt;httperf&lt;/a&gt; but found that ramping up the load caused the tool to segfault.  We‚Äôre not sure if this is related to our changes to the source but decided to give up on httperf at this point.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;We switched back to looking at &lt;a href=&quot;http://tsung.erlang-projects.org/&quot;&gt;tsung&lt;/a&gt; but couldn‚Äôt get around the problem with it not being able to connect to an http server over SSL.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;We finally spent some time with &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.joedog.org/index/siege-home&quot;&gt;siege&lt;/a&gt;.  This tool had problems with our session cookies.  A little foray into the source appeared to reveal that session cookies are retrieved and then immediately removed as they don‚Äôt have an explicit expiry date set.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Other stuff&lt;/h2&gt;

  &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://twitter.com/serenamchugh&quot;&gt;Serena&lt;/a&gt; and I went for an assessment session with &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.rickkiddle.com/&quot;&gt;Rick Kiddle&lt;/a&gt; in the hope that we might, one day, be able to have a crack at &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.channelswimmingassociation.com/&quot;&gt;swimming the channel&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;

        <title>Day notes - Mon 11th Oct 2010</title>
        <description>&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Worked with &lt;a href=&quot;http://interblah.net/&quot;&gt;James A&lt;/a&gt; to get the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.hmrc.gov.uk/employers/cdrom/index.htm&quot;&gt;HMRC employer‚Äôs CD&lt;/a&gt; set-up.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;ul&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;We keep the data directory in a shared &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.dropbox.com&quot;&gt;dropbox&lt;/a&gt; so that all of us can use the app from any machine and connect to the same data directory.  Although multiple people &lt;em&gt;can&lt;/em&gt; have the app open at one time (pointing at their local dropbox copies of the data) only the last edit/save will win.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;You can customise the data directory (post-install) by editing the configuration/projectSpecific/userPath key in the /PATH/TO/HMRC/Employer CD-ROM 2010/shared/xml/configuration.xml configuration file (that‚Äôs on a Mac).&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;The app actually appears to be made of a webserver (running on &lt;a href=&quot;http://127.0.0.1:46721&quot;&gt;http://127.0.0.1:46721&lt;/a&gt; by default) and a flash front end app.  It looks as though you can do everything through the web app if you don‚Äôt care for the flash front end.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;We got an error when trying to submit a form to the HMRC gateway.  The error was something along the lines of ‚Äòmissing or invalid XML in /PATH/TO/HMRC/Employer CD-ROM 2010/shared/xml/forms/2010/p45_part3_zap/script.xml‚Äô.  We noticed that the p45_part3_zap directory had been created with a capital P (i.e. P45_part3_zap): aliasing this as p45_part3_zap and re-starting the app fixed the problem.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;/ul&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Worked with &lt;a href=&quot;http://blog.floehopper.org/&quot;&gt;James M&lt;/a&gt; getting an understanding of &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.hpl.hp.com/research/linux/httperf/&quot;&gt;httperf&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;ul&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Patched our copy of httperf as the standard version limits cookies to 256 bytes and the cookies that rails generates by default are larger than that.  Luckily, someone else had already &lt;a href=&quot;http://github.com/Gregg/httperf_big_cookies&quot;&gt;done the work for us&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;We started to get an understanding of the stats that httperf generates.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;/ul&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

        <title>Day notes - Fri 8th Oct 2010</title>
        <description>&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Moved this website from &lt;a href=&quot;http://chrisroos.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/websites/chrisroos.co.uk/&quot;&gt;subversion on google code&lt;/a&gt; to &lt;a href=&quot;http://github.com/chrisroos/chrisroos.co.uk&quot;&gt;github&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Lost a load of historical subversion commits in the process of moving the source of this site (github appears to import the x most recent commits).  I would‚Äôve cared about this in the past but decided that having the current site in git was more important than working out how to keep them.  Actually, having said that, they‚Äôll all still be in the subversion repository should I wish to revisit them.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Removed my life.chrisroos.co.uk tumblr site.  It was, at one time, aggregating a bunch of other sites.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Updated a few things on this site - mainly around what I‚Äôm up to these days.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Downloaded the last months worth of &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.southeasternrailway.co.uk/your-journey/daily-performance/&quot;&gt;south eastern‚Äôs daily performance reports&lt;/a&gt; and popped them in git.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Added &lt;a href=&quot;http://gembundler.com&quot;&gt;gembundler&lt;/a&gt; to my &lt;a href=&quot;http://github.com/chrisroos/southeastern-daily-performance&quot;&gt;southeastern-daily-performance&lt;/a&gt; project and got all the tests passing again.  The next step will be to make sure it can actually convert the downloaded performance reports.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

        <title>Day notes - Thurs 7th Oct 2010</title>
        <description>&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Wrote up some meeting notes from yesterday.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Noticed that our shared google calendars were empty.  Allowed myself to get distracted by this and spent some time building a simple backup thing so that our calendars are now regularly uploaded to git.  Using this &lt;a href=&quot;http://gist.github.com/614972&quot;&gt;Command line util&lt;/a&gt; and some cron magic.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;  # Min   Hour    Day   Month   Day of week   Command
    0     */2     *     *       *             /path/to/bin/download-calendar http://link-to-google-calendar.ics /path/to/calendars &amp;gt;&amp;gt; /path/to/logs/download-calendar.log
    2     */2     *     *       *             cd /path/to/calendars &amp;amp;&amp;amp; /path/to/git add . &amp;amp;&amp;amp; /path/to/git commit -m &quot;Updating calendars&quot; &amp;amp;&amp;amp; /path/to/git push &amp;gt; /dev/null
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Spent longer than I‚Äôd hoped creating the backup thingy, partly because I was bitten by crontab treating the percent-sign as a newline.  From the &lt;a href=&quot;http://unixhelp.ed.ac.uk/CGI/man-cgi?crontab+5&quot;&gt;crontab manpage&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;blockquote&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;Percent-signs (%) in the command, unless escaped with backslash (\), will be changed into newline characters, and all data after the first % will be sent to the command as standard input.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/blockquote&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Paired with &lt;a href=&quot;http://blog.floehopper.org/&quot;&gt;James M&lt;/a&gt; to attempt to understand &lt;a href=&quot;http://tsung.erlang-projects.org/&quot;&gt;tsung&lt;/a&gt;.  The documentation around the format of the output is, err, somewhat lacking.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

        <title>Libxml2 Problems When Installing Nokogiri</title>
        <description>&lt;h2&gt;The problem&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Trying to install &lt;a href=&quot;http://nokogiri.org/&quot;&gt;nokogiri&lt;/a&gt; on Mac OS X 10.5.8 (Leopard) using &lt;a href=&quot;http://github.com/carlhuda/bundler&quot;&gt;gem bundler&lt;/a&gt;, or more specifically as a non root user (e.g. installing into ~/.gem/), failed with the error below.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class=&quot;code shell&quot;&gt;
  checking for xmlParseDoc() in -lxml2... no
  libxml2 is missing.  try &#39;port install libxml2&#39; or &#39;yum install libxml2&#39;
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Using sudo to install (sudo gem install nokogiri or sudo gem bundle) resulted in the gem installing without a problem.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;The solution&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href=&quot;http://gcc.gnu.org/&quot;&gt;gcc&lt;/a&gt; command being executed to test whether libxml2 existed was looking for both i386 and ppc (universal) libraries, where I only had the i386 versions installed via &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.macports.org/&quot;&gt;Macports&lt;/a&gt; (&lt;code&gt;$ file /opt/local/lib/libxml2.2.dylib #=&amp;gt; /opt/local/lib/libxml2.2.dylib: Mach-O dynamically linked shared library i386&lt;/code&gt;)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Solution 1&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;pre class=&quot;code shell&quot;&gt;
  # Instruct gcc to check for i386 libraries only

  $ RC_ARCHS=&quot;i386&quot; gem install nokogiri
  # or
  $ ARCHFLAGS=&quot;-arch i386&quot; gem install nokogiri
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Solution 2&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;pre class=&quot;code shell&quot;&gt;
  # Install universal (i.e. i386 and ppc) versions of libxml and libxslt

  $ sudo port upgrade --enforce-variants libxml2 +universal
  $ sudo port upgrade libxslt2 +universal
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;The explanation&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The error message (libxml2 is missing) was somewhat cryptic.  I knew it was installed via macports and as part of the stock Leopard install.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class=&quot;code shell&quot;&gt;
  $ port installed | grep libxml2.*active
    libxml2 @2.7.5_0 (active)
  $ ls -l /usr/lib | grep libxml2
    -rwxr-xr-x   1 root  wheel   4502144 29 Sep 00:00 libxml2.2.dylib
    lrwxr-xr-x   1 root  wheel        15 17 Aug 09:46 libxml2.dylib -&amp;gt; libxml2.2.dylib
    -rwxr-xr-x   1 root  wheel       819 27 Jun  2008 libxml2.la
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After a little digging I discovered that the error was being raised by line 124 of &lt;a href=&quot;http://github.com/tenderlove/nokogiri/blob/master/ext/nokogiri/extconf.rb&quot;&gt;extconf.rb in nokogiri&lt;/a&gt;.  In fact, I could replicate the error by checking out a copy of nokogiri and running the following command.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class=&quot;code shell&quot;&gt;
  $ cd /path/to/clone/of/nokogiri &amp;amp;&amp;amp; ruby ext/nokogiri/extconf.rb
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Trial and error using The One True Ruby Debugger (scattering p statements throughout the file) lead me to realise that the problem was being caused by the &lt;a href=&quot;http://ruby-doc.org/stdlib/libdoc/mkmf/rdoc/files/mkmf_rb.html#M000549&quot;&gt;dir_config&lt;/a&gt; call on line 62 of that same file.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The simplest example I came up with to expose the problem was as follows.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class=&quot;code shell&quot;&gt;
  $ cat &amp;gt; wem_extconf.rb
  require &#39;mkmf&#39;
  find_library(&#39;xml2&#39;, &#39;xmlParseDoc&#39;)
  dir_config(&#39;any-string-here&#39;, &#39;/opt/local/include&#39;, &#39;/opt/local/lib&#39;)
  find_library(&#39;xml2&#39;, &#39;xmlParseDoc&#39;)
  &amp;lt;ctrl-d&amp;gt;
  $ ruby wem_extconf.rb
  checking for xmlParseDoc() in -lxml2... yes
  checking for xmlParseDoc() in -lxml2... no
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After lots of digging into &lt;a href=&quot;http://ruby-doc.org/stdlib/libdoc/mkmf/rdoc/index.html&quot;&gt;mkmf.rb&lt;/a&gt; I was able to determine the command being executed in order to check whether libxml2 existed (or, more accurately, whether the xmlParseDoc function existed in libxml2).  It turns out that the commands executed are actually logged to the mkmf.log that&amp;#8217;s generated as part of running extconf.rb but, although I was aware of the mkmf.log file, I didn&amp;#8217;t realise it contained the commands until now.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These are the relevant lines from mkmf.log after a failed install of nokogiri.  If you were trying to install nokogiri to your home gem directory then this log file would be in ~/.gem/ruby/1.8/gems/nokogiri-1.4.1/ext/nokogiri/mkmf.log (where the nokogiri version would be specific to the version you were installing).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class=&quot;code shell&quot;&gt;

&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In order to detect whether a function exists within a library (my terminology is probably wrong here) mkmf uses gcc to execute some c code that tries to call the function.  It tries twice, changing the c code used.  We can see the two commands run in the above log extract (both starting gcc) and the source of the c code used (wrapped in the /begin/ and /end/ comments below the gcc lines).  Armed with this knowledge we can replicate the tests manually on the command line.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class=&quot;code shell&quot;&gt;
  $ # Test 1
  $ cat &amp;gt; conftest.c
  int main() { return 0; }
  int t() { void ((*volatile p)()); p = (void ((*)()))xmlParseDoc; return 0; }
  &amp;lt;ctrl-d&amp;gt;
  $ gcc -o conftest -I/opt/local/include/libxml2 -I/opt/local/include/ -I. -I/System/Library/Frameworks/Ruby.framework/Versions/1.8/usr/lib/ruby/1.8/universal-darwin9.0 -I. -I/opt/local/include/ -I/opt/local/include/libxml2 -I/opt/local/include   -arch ppc -arch i386 -Os -pipe -fno-common  -g -DXP_UNIX -O3 -Wall -Wcast-qual -Wwrite-strings -Wconversion -Wmissing-noreturn -Winline conftest.c  -L. -L/System/Library/Frameworks/Ruby.framework/Versions/1.8/usr/lib -L/opt/local/lib -L. -arch ppc -arch i386     -lruby -lxml2  -lpthread -ldl -lm
  # Snipped output
  $ echo $?
  1

  $ # Test 2
  $ cat &amp;gt; conftest.c
  int main() { return 0; }
  int t() { xmlParseDoc(); return 0; }
  &amp;lt;ctrl-d&amp;gt;
  $ gcc -o conftest -I/opt/local/include/libxml2 -I/opt/local/include/ -I. -I/System/Library/Frameworks/Ruby.framework/Versions/1.8/usr/lib/ruby/1.8/universal-darwin9.0 -I. -I/opt/local/include/ -I/opt/local/include/libxml2 -I/opt/local/include   -arch ppc -arch i386 -Os -pipe -fno-common  -g -DXP_UNIX -O3 -Wall -Wcast-qual -Wwrite-strings -Wconversion -Wmissing-noreturn -Winline conftest.c  -L. -L/System/Library/Frameworks/Ruby.framework/Versions/1.8/usr/lib -L/opt/local/lib -L. -arch ppc -arch i386     -lruby -lxml2  -lpthread -ldl -lm
  # Snipped output
  $ echo $?
  1
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The next step was to compare the gcc command being run when it reported the library as found to the above unsuccessful commands.  It turns out that the only difference in the commands was the presence of an additional -L option (-L/opt/local/lib) in the failed command.  This additional -L option was the effect of the call to dir_config (from the mkmf.rb rdoc for dir_config, &amp;#8220;Note that dir_config only adds to the list of places to search for libraries and include files&amp;#8221;).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To double check that this was the case I repeated Test 2 with this additional -L switch removed.  We still get some warnings but we get an exit code of 0 representing success (i.e. the function was found).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class=&quot;code shell&quot;&gt;
  $ # Test 2
  $ cat &amp;gt; conftest.c
  int main() { return 0; }
  int t() { xmlParseDoc(); return 0; }
  &amp;lt;ctrl-d&amp;gt;
  $ gcc -o conftest -I/opt/local/include/libxml2 -I/opt/local/include/ -I. -I/System/Library/Frameworks/Ruby.framework/Versions/1.8/usr/lib/ruby/1.8/universal-darwin9.0 -I. -I/opt/local/include/ -I/opt/local/include/libxml2 -I/opt/local/include   -arch ppc -arch i386 -Os -pipe -fno-common  -g -DXP_UNIX -O3 -Wall -Wcast-qual -Wwrite-strings -Wconversion -Wmissing-noreturn -Winline conftest.c  -L. -L/System/Library/Frameworks/Ruby.framework/Versions/1.8/usr/lib  -L. -arch ppc -arch i386     -lruby -lxml2  -lpthread -ldl -lm
  conftest.c: In function ‚Äòt‚Äô:
  conftest.c:2: warning: implicit declaration of function ‚ÄòxmlParseDoc‚Äô
  conftest.c: In function ‚Äòt‚Äô:
  conftest.c:2: warning: implicit declaration of function ‚ÄòxmlParseDoc‚Äô
  $ echo $?
  0
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I figured that the presence of this flag meant that it was using libxml2 from /opt/local/lib (which was failing for some reason), and an absence meant it used libxml2 from /usr/lib (which worked).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Unfortunately, although you can tell gcc to consider additional paths when searching for the xml2 library (using something like &lt;code&gt;gem install nokogiri -- --with-xml2-dir=/usr&lt;/code&gt;) these paths are added after those added by the call to dir_config.  Because I was trying to add a path that gcc considers by default (/usr/lib) the setting of this compile time option didn&amp;#8217;t actually have any effect.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Having got this far I was still unsure of a fix.  I thought about removing libxml2 from ports but it was required by &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.imagemagick.org&quot;&gt;ImageMagick&lt;/a&gt; (among other things) which meant that this wasn&amp;#8217;t really an option.  Finally, after quite a bit of googling I came across &lt;a href=&quot;http://passingcuriosity.com/2009/installing-pil-on-mac-os-x-leopard/&quot;&gt;this post&lt;/a&gt; that covered a similar error encountered installing &lt;span class=&quot;caps&quot;&gt;PIL&lt;/span&gt; (Python Imaging Library) on Leopard.  The solution here was to install the universal version of libxml2 from macports.  I tried the same thing (I had to install the universal version of libxslt2 too) and it appears to have done the trick, although I have absolutely no idea why.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Not content to leave it there I continued to investigate, albeit some time after I&amp;#8217;d written the stuff above.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Although installing the libxml2 universal libraries did the trick I still wasn&amp;#8217;t sure why it worked as sudo (without the universal libs) but not as my regular user.  I continued to dig and worked out that it was all down to my setting the &lt;span class=&quot;caps&quot;&gt;RUPYOPT&lt;/span&gt; environment variable to rubygems (&lt;span class=&quot;caps&quot;&gt;RUBYOPT&lt;/span&gt;=&amp;#8220;rubygems&amp;#8221;).  It turns out that &lt;a href=&quot;http://rubygems.rubyforge.org/svn/tags/REL_1_3_5/lib/rubygems.rb&quot;&gt;rubygems.rb&lt;/a&gt; (line 168 in rubygems v1.3.5 on my machine) requires rbconfig.rb (/usr/lib/ruby/1.8/universal-darwin9.0/rbconfig.rb on my machine) which in turn defines the &lt;span class=&quot;caps&quot;&gt;ARCHFLAGS&lt;/span&gt; constant.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class=&quot;code ruby&quot;&gt;
  ARCHFLAGS =
    if e = ENV[&#39;ARCHFLAGS&#39;]
      e
    elsif e = ENV[&#39;RC_ARCHS&#39;]
      e.split.map { |a| &quot;-arch #{a}&quot; }.join(&#39; &#39;)
    else
      &#39;-arch ppc -arch i386&#39;
    end
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We can see that &lt;span class=&quot;caps&quot;&gt;ARCHFLAGS&lt;/span&gt; defaults to &amp;#8216;-arch ppc -arch i386&amp;#8217; if neither &lt;span class=&quot;caps&quot;&gt;ARCHFLAGS&lt;/span&gt; or RC_ARCHS are defined (i.e. compile universal binaries; search for &amp;#8220;-arch arch&amp;#8221; in the &lt;a href=&quot;http://developer.apple.com/mac/library/DOCUMENTATION/Darwin/Reference/ManPages/man1/gcc.1.html&quot;&gt;gcc man page&lt;/a&gt;). However, &lt;a href=&quot;http://github.com/tenderlove/nokogiri/blob/REL_1.4.1/ext/nokogiri/extconf.rb#L1&quot;&gt;extconf.rb in Nokogiri sets RC_ARCHS to an empty string&lt;/a&gt; meaning that as long as extconf.rb is required before rbconfig.rb then gcc won&amp;#8217;t try to compile against universal libraries.  When I installed nokogiri as sudo this is exactly what happened (extconf.rb is required which in turn requires &lt;a href=&quot;http://svn.ruby-lang.org/repos/ruby/tags/v1_8_6_287/lib/mkmf.rb&quot;&gt;mkmf&lt;/a&gt; which in turn requires rbconfig.rb).  When I installed as my user (with &lt;span class=&quot;caps&quot;&gt;RUBYOPT&lt;/span&gt;=&amp;#8220;rubygems&amp;#8221;) extconf.rb was required &lt;strong&gt;after&lt;/strong&gt; rbconfig.rb which means that &lt;span class=&quot;caps&quot;&gt;ARCHFLAGS&lt;/span&gt; had already been set to compile against universal binaries.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We can see the difference between requiring rubygems before requiring rbconfig with these two commands:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class=&quot;code shell&quot;&gt;
  $ ruby -e&#39;p [ENV[&quot;RUBYOPT&quot;], require(&quot;rbconfig&quot;)]&#39; #=&amp;gt; [&quot;rubygems&quot;, false] (false because rbconfig has already been required)
  $ sudo ruby -e&#39;p [ENV[&quot;RUBYOPT&quot;], require(&quot;rbconfig&quot;)]&#39; #=&amp;gt; [nil, true] (true because rbconfig hasn&#39;t been required)
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;NOTE. I noticed that there was a file named rbconfig.rb.orig in the same directory as rbconfig.rb and a little digging revealed this &lt;a href=&quot;http://opensource.apple.com/source/ruby/ruby-67.3/patches/rbconfig.diff&quot;&gt;apple patch to rbconfig.rb&lt;/a&gt;.  I&amp;#8217;m guessing this patch was applied to the stock Leopard install of Ruby 1.8.6 (i.e. it&amp;#8217;s been there since the OS was installed) but I can&amp;#8217;t be 100% sure.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now, that&amp;#8217;s almost the story over, but not quite.  My original hypothesis was that installing with sudo was causing gcc to link against /usr/lib/libxml2.2.dylib (compiled for ppc, ppc64, i386 and x86_64; see below) and installing as my user was causing gcc to link against /opt/local/lib/libxml2.2.dylib (compiled for i386 only) which failed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class=&quot;code shell&quot;&gt;
  $  file /usr/lib/libxml2.2.dylib
  /usr/lib/libxml2.2.dylib: Mach-O universal binary with 4 architectures
  /usr/lib/libxml2.2.dylib (for architecture ppc7400):  Mach-O dynamically linked shared library ppc
  /usr/lib/libxml2.2.dylib (for architecture ppc64):  Mach-O 64-bit dynamically linked shared library ppc64
  /usr/lib/libxml2.2.dylib (for architecture i386):  Mach-O dynamically linked shared library i386
  /usr/lib/libxml2.2.dylib (for architecture x86_64):  Mach-O 64-bit dynamically linked shared library x86_64
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But, the rubygems/rbconfig discovery changes things.  You see, when I install nokogiri now (using sudo and as my user), and compare the gcc commands from mkmf.log I see that the only difference is the lack of the &lt;span class=&quot;caps&quot;&gt;ARCHFLAGS&lt;/span&gt; (-arch ppc -arch i386) when installed as sudo, and their presence when installed as my user.  &lt;span class=&quot;caps&quot;&gt;NOTE&lt;/span&gt;. The -L /opt/local/lib argument is present in both cases.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I can&amp;#8217;t replicate my initial findings (the absence/presence of -L /opt/local/lib in the gcc commands) so can only assume that something else on the system has changed between my original writeup and continued investigation, or that I&amp;#8217;m going mad.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#8217;m still not 100% sure that I&amp;#8217;ve answered all my questions about everything I came across in my investigation but I&amp;#8217;ve got to stop at some point.  I&amp;#8217;ve been dipping into this post on and off for about a month and just want to get it published.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

        <title>Converting Egg Statements and Transactions to Ofx</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;Wow, it was around &lt;a href=&quot;/blog/2007-04-01-converting-egg-credit-card-statements-to-ofx-for-upload-to-wesabe&quot;&gt;two and half years ago&lt;/a&gt; that I first hacked together a little utility to do this.  I&amp;#8217;ve pretty much neglected the code since then but have always intended to get back to it.  Over the last week or so I&amp;#8217;ve done just that (&lt;a href=&quot;http://github.com/chrisroos/egg2ofx&quot;&gt;egg2ofx on github&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#8217;d like to think that this version is a little more usable.  You can install it as a gem for a start.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class=&quot;code shell&quot;&gt;
$ gem install egg2ofx --source http://gemcutter.org
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With that, you get a nice little binary that you can use to convert a downloaded copy of your statement or recent transactions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class=&quot;code shell&quot;&gt;
$ egg2ofx downloaded-statement.html &amp;gt; egg-statement.ofx
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As if that wasn&amp;#8217;t enough, I&amp;#8217;ve also created a little &lt;a href=&quot;http://github.com/chrisroos/egg2ofx-server&quot;&gt;web service&lt;/a&gt; that exposes the conversion functionality over http.  Assuming you&amp;#8217;ve got &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.ruby-lang.org/en/&quot;&gt;ruby&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;http://curl.haxx.se/&quot;&gt;curl&lt;/a&gt; (and probably other stuff) installed you should be able to do something like this to try it out.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class=&quot;code shell&quot;&gt;
$ cat downloaded-statement.html | ruby -rcgi -e &quot;puts &#39;documentHtml=&#39; + CGI.escape(STDIN.read)&quot; | curl http://egg2ofx.seagul.co.uk -d@-
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Where we pipe the content of the downloaded statement into a single line ruby script that constructs the key/value pair that we need to send to the service and pipes that into curl that actually makes the &lt;span class=&quot;caps&quot;&gt;POST&lt;/span&gt; request (the magic &lt;code&gt;-d@-&lt;/code&gt; means, read from stdin).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The final little treat is a &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greasemonkey&quot;&gt;greasemonkey&lt;/a&gt; script that adds a button to the egg transactions and statement pages allowing you to download them as Ofx right there.  Whoah.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.flickr.com/photos/chrisjroos/4113433456/&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2764/4113433456_662c0fec1e_m.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;caps&quot;&gt;VERY&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;caps&quot;&gt;IMPORTANT&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;  If you happen to use the greasemonkey script, or manually send your data to the web service, you should be aware that you&amp;#8217;re sending your account details (including account number, balance and transactions) &lt;strong&gt;IN &lt;span class=&quot;caps&quot;&gt;THE&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;caps&quot;&gt;CLEAR&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; to my server.  I certainly won&amp;#8217;t keep any logs of what gets sent but I can&amp;#8217;t promise the same thing of any of the servers in between your computer and my server.  I might see if I can get an &lt;span class=&quot;caps&quot;&gt;SSL&lt;/span&gt; certificate installed but, unless I can get one freely or incredibly cheaply, you shouldn&amp;#8217;t hold out much hope for this.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A much better idea would be to install the web service on your own machine.  I don&amp;#8217;t know how this might work on Windows but the combination of &lt;a href=&quot;http://httpd.apache.org/&quot;&gt;Apache&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.modrails.com/&quot;&gt;passenger&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.fngtps.com/passenger-preference-pane&quot;&gt;passenger preference pane&lt;/a&gt; make it trivial on a Mac.  There are &lt;a href=&quot;http://github.com/chrisroos/egg2ofx-server#readme&quot;&gt;instructions&lt;/a&gt; to get the web service installed locally on github, along with &lt;a href=&quot;http://github.com/chrisroos/egg2ofx-greasemonkey#readme&quot;&gt;instructions&lt;/a&gt; to change the server that the greasemonkey script sends the data to.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

        <title>A Letter to Adrian Gillan at Euroferries</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#8217;ve just sent this email to Adrian Gillan at &lt;a href=&quot;http://euroferries.co.uk/&quot;&gt;Euroferries&lt;/a&gt; in response to his request that &lt;a href=&quot;http://twitter.com/adem&quot;&gt;Adem&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;http://ademdjemil.co.uk/blog/?p=1867&quot;&gt;remove one of his posts&lt;/a&gt;.  I&amp;#8217;m just popping this up here to support Adem really.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;emailBody&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hi Adrian,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#8217;ve just seen your email to Adem (a friend of mine) published on his blog&lt;sup class=&quot;footnote&quot; id=&quot;fnr1&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn1&quot;&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;.  I don&amp;#8217;t know what the allegedly libelous comments were (Google have cached the page up to the early hours of the 6th Nov&lt;sup class=&quot;footnote&quot; id=&quot;fnr2&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn2&quot;&gt;2&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; and a quick scan doesn&amp;#8217;t reveal anything terrible) but this just doesn&amp;#8217;t feel like a friendly way to operate.  I know that Adem, and  many others (myself included), are excited by the possibility of this new ferry service from Ramsgate and only want the best for the area.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Anyway, I just wanted to suggest a slightly different approach you might want to consider in future.  Rather than use these old school heavy handed tactics why not jump into the comments on this (and many others about Euroferries) post and correct people if they&amp;#8217;re pushing mistaken ideas.  Taking it a little further, you could even start a Euroferries blog and keep in touch with people that way.  If you communicated in this way people wouldn&amp;#8217;t have to constantly guess at what might be going on.  I&amp;#8217;d certainly be willing (as I&amp;#8217;m sure would many others) to help you set this up if it&amp;#8217;s something you&amp;#8217;d be interested in.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Cheers, and all the best for the launch (next week, right?)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Chris&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;1. &lt;a href=&quot;http://ademdjemil.co.uk/blog/?p=1867&quot;&gt;http://ademdjemil.co.uk/blog/?p=1867&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;

        <title>Things I Learnt at Interesting 2009</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;Some things I learnt at &lt;a href=&quot;http://russelldavies.typepad.com/planning/interesting2009/&quot;&gt;interesting 2009&lt;/a&gt;.  Note.  Some of this stuff is probably made up.  If you want to see what actually happened you should read the &lt;a href=&quot;http://rooreynolds.com/2009/09/12/interesting-2009-forty-even-more-interesting-things/&quot;&gt;coverage by Roo Reynolds&lt;/a&gt; (in theory my numbers match the numbers in Roo&amp;#8217;s list).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Boats can fly.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;The kids of today will feel sorry for us because we don&amp;#8217;t take steroids.  &lt;span class=&quot;caps&quot;&gt;THEN&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;caps&quot;&gt;THEY&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;caps&quot;&gt;WILL&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;caps&quot;&gt;DESTROY&lt;/span&gt; US.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;We are all gentlemen.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Cheating in computer games is good, as long as you don&amp;#8217;t get caught.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Adventure books can be funny.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Stan Laurel&amp;#8217;s dad invented theatre.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;God invented subduction zones for us to hide our nuclear waste in: they&amp;#8217;re like giant dustcarts.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Robots are all made of win (although not clear, I believe this is some advanced alien technology).&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Twitter can blow bubbles.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Lilac doesn&amp;#8217;t exist.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Keyboards are string instruments (ok, so this is actually true but I had to think about it when it was being talked about, because I&amp;#8217;m an idiot).&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;r2d2 has been made into every product ever built.  Apollo 22 was actually made to look like the little fella.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Morse invented kazoos and chocolate.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Maps are better when they&amp;#8217;re a list of words, rather than, you know, a map.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Much loved girl comics from the 70s and 80s were written by famous horror writers, including Stephen King.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Francis Galton could smell maths.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Children&amp;#8217;s art is better than a lot of what&amp;#8217;s in the Tate Modern.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Magners isn&amp;#8217;t cider.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Origami is actually impossible and all origami seen on TV has been computer generated by a supercomputer running for weeks on end.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;It&amp;#8217;s easier to buy strands of banana smell dna and upload them into yoghurt than it is to buy a banana flavoured yoghurt.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Conductors love coffee, chocolate cake and david beckham.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;You can never record too much data about your daily life.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Breast shot is also the name of a waterwheel.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Cartoons are like films that play at about 1 frame per second for 6 frames.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;India has superpowers.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Burn giant wooden men or kill goats.  It&amp;#8217;s up to you.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Writing a book takes ages so make sure you pick a fairly general topic (social web apps, or religion, I guess).&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Having imaginary ponies doesn&amp;#8217;t stop you from going on stage and talking about said imaginary ponies.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Cycling around the UK takes you up someones wife&amp;#8217;s lane.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Bill and Ted, the musical, is being presented live in and around Oxford next year.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Darwin invented Chinese Whispers.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Making incomprehensible noise.  There&amp;#8217;s an app for that.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;All train lines are built on top of underground rivers.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;You shouldn&amp;#8217;t play Monopoly.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Some schools have now completely reversed the role of pupils and teachers with the pupils now teaching the staff.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;John Prescott listens to his ipod at night while planting sunflowers.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Astrotagging is done by a little robot that comes out of your computer and sits on your desk.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;1. Make clothes, 2. Make &lt;span class=&quot;caps&quot;&gt;TED&lt;/span&gt; clone, 3. You&amp;#8217;re done.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;France has the only bullet viewing platform, on top of the Eiffel tower.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Sunsets are caused by the sun disappearing.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All in all it was a great, and inspiring, day.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

        <title>Pouring Factlets Into Your Brain Holder via Your Ear Sieves</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;I was walking past &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.haysgalleria.co.uk/&quot;&gt;Hays Galleria&lt;/a&gt; on the way to work the other morning and realised that I didn&amp;#8217;t really know anything about it.  I was listening to &lt;a href=&quot;http://listen.googlelabs.com/&quot;&gt;streaming podcasts&lt;/a&gt; on my &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Global_Positioning_System&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;caps&quot;&gt;GPS&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt; enabled &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.android.com/&quot;&gt;Android&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.htc.com/www/product/g1/overview.html&quot;&gt;G1&lt;/a&gt; and started thinking about receiving little factlets (I originally wrote factoid but apparently that means an unverified statement taken as truth&lt;sup class=&quot;footnote&quot; id=&quot;fnr1&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn1&quot;&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;) as I walk around.  I&amp;#8217;ve thought about this a bit more and think it&amp;#8217;d be really quite a good thing.  It&amp;#8217;d be like the audio tours you get in museums and the like but defined purely by where &lt;strong&gt;you&lt;/strong&gt; go, rather than you having to follow a pre-determined path.  So, assuming there&amp;#8217;s not already something similar out there (I wouldn&amp;#8217;t be surprised if there was) then I&amp;#8217;m going to build it.  Does this sound interesting to anyone else, specifically developer types that can help me actually build it?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;An off-the-top-of-my-head plan:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Store some geotagged audio somewhere.
	&lt;ul&gt;
		&lt;li&gt;Could we use &lt;a href=&quot;http://twaud.io/&quot;&gt;twaud.io&lt;/a&gt; (directly or build on top of it)?&lt;/li&gt;
		&lt;li&gt;There is some &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.google.co.uk/search?q=geotagged+audio&quot;&gt;prior art&lt;/a&gt; here&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Create an Android application.  We&amp;#8217;d need to be able to:
	&lt;ul&gt;
		&lt;li&gt;Search for audio based on current location.&lt;/li&gt;
		&lt;li&gt;Stream and play audio.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Make the creation of geotagged audio easier.
	&lt;ul&gt;
		&lt;li&gt;Can we use text to voice to convert fragments of &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geotagging#Wikipedia&quot;&gt;geotagged wikipedia articles&lt;/a&gt;?&lt;/li&gt;
		&lt;li&gt;Can we create a game that makes the generation of this audio content appealing to more people?&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Allow people to upload their own factlets when they&amp;#8217;re out and about.
	&lt;ul&gt;
		&lt;li&gt;twaud.io already enables uploading of audio, we&amp;#8217;d just need to geotag it.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;footnote&quot; id=&quot;fn1&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fnr1&quot;&gt;&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/a&gt; Or does it?&lt;/p&gt;</description>

        <title>Creating a Greasemonkey Script That Applies to the Firefox 'Problem Loading Page' Error Page</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;I found a few things when developing the &lt;a href=&quot;/blog/2009-06-24-down-for-everyone-or-just-me-greasemonkey-script&quot;&gt;down for everyone&lt;/a&gt; greasemonkey script that might be of use to someone else wanting to customise the &amp;#8216;Problem loading page&amp;#8217; error page.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I originally based my script on this &lt;a href=&quot;http://userscripts.org/scripts/show/4125&quot;&gt;Server not found? Try and try again&lt;/a&gt; script.  Specifically, I used something like this to determine whether or not the error page was being displayed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class=&quot;code javascript&quot;&gt;
  if (document.documentURI.substr(0,14)==&quot;about:neterror&quot;) {
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Given this I was able to find, and use, this similar code from &lt;a href=&quot;chrome://browser/content/browser.js&quot;&gt;chrome://browser/content/browser.js&lt;/a&gt; (paste that link into the location bar and search for about:neterror or the aboutNeterror constant).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class=&quot;code javascript&quot;&gt;
  if (/^about:neterror/.test(document.documentURI)) {
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#8217;m still not exactly sure of the purpose of document.documentURI except that it appears to allow you to display one &lt;span class=&quot;caps&quot;&gt;URI&lt;/span&gt; and actually render another (in this case it displays the &lt;span class=&quot;caps&quot;&gt;URI&lt;/span&gt; you&amp;#8217;re trying to access but renders the error page).  This error page also appears to screw with &lt;a href=&quot;http://getfirebug.com&quot;&gt;firebug&lt;/a&gt;.  If you want to see the value of documentURI you&amp;#8217;ll need to use this little bit of javascript in the location bar:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class=&quot;code javascript&quot;&gt;
  javascript:alert(document.documentURI);
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It turns out that you can&amp;#8217;t directly view the source of the &amp;#8216;Problem loading page&amp;#8217; error page: Press Ctrl-U, or select View &amp;gt; Page Source from the menu, and you&amp;#8217;ll be presented with the error page in a popup window.  In order to view the source you&amp;#8217;ll need to load it, using the chrome protocol, from &lt;a href=&quot;chrome://global/content/netError.xhtml&quot;&gt;chrome://global/content/netError.xhtml&lt;/a&gt; (paste that into the location bar).  The error page (which lives in firefox-dir/chrome/toolkit.jar/content/global/netError.xhtml) is pretty empty as it uses javascript to read querystring parameters and populate it on the fly.  This allows the same error page to be used for multiple types of error.  You can see an example of changing the description in this link: &lt;a href=&quot;chrome://global/content/netError.xhtml?e=dnsNotFound&amp;amp;u=http%3A//example.com&amp;amp;d=I%20can%20see%20you...&quot;&gt;about:neterror?e=dnsNotFound&amp;amp;u=http%3A//example.com&amp;amp;d=I%20can%20see%20you&amp;#8230;&lt;/a&gt; (paste that link into the location bar).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I initially tried to add a button next to the &amp;#8216;Try Again&amp;#8217; button that appears on the page.  My first attempt was to create a xul:button (which is the type of the &amp;#8216;Try Again&amp;#8217; button) but that didn&amp;#8217;t work.  I don&amp;#8217;t remember the exact details but I don&amp;#8217;t think I was able to get addEventListener working in order to attach events to the button.  I was able to create a standard html button but the xul.css stylesheet didn&amp;#8217;t get applied and it therefore looked odd next to the &amp;#8216;Try Again&amp;#8217; button.  Comments in the source of the &lt;a href=&quot;http://userscripts.org/scripts/review/4125&quot;&gt;Server not found? Try and try again&lt;/a&gt; script lead me to believe that the developer of that script ran into these same problems with the button.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While digging through the firefox source files I noticed a few files that I found interesting/amusing and hadn&amp;#8217;t come across before: &lt;a href=&quot;about:mozilla&quot;&gt;about:mozilla&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;about:robots&quot;&gt;about:robots&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;about:crashes&quot;&gt;about:crashes&lt;/a&gt; (I&amp;#8217;m not sure why but this link doesn&amp;#8217;t appear to work directly, copy and paste it to the location bar to see the page).&lt;/p&gt;</description>

        <title>Down for Everyone or Just Me Greasemonkey Script</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;I hacked on this simple &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greasemonkey&quot;&gt;greasemonkey&lt;/a&gt; script a while ago but never got around to writing about it.  It&amp;#8217;s probably easiest explained with a screenshot.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.flickr.com/photos/chrisjroos/3658162176/&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3653/3658162176_d6819a620d_m.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If the webpage you&amp;#8217;re trying to access can&amp;#8217;t be loaded then you&amp;#8217;ll see that the standard &amp;#8216;page not found&amp;#8217; firefox error page but with an additional link to the useful &lt;a href=&quot;http://downforeveryoneorjustme.com/&quot;&gt;Down for everyone or just me&lt;/a&gt; service.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Get the script from &lt;a href=&quot;http://userscripts.org/scripts/show/50164&quot;&gt;userscripts&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

        <title>Apacherb Is Now Hostess</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;A little while ago I wrote about a utility called &lt;a href=&quot;/blog/2008-12-15-a-utility-to-manage-apache-virtual-hosts-on-a-mac-like-the-passenger-pref-pane-but-for-simple-static-sites&quot;&gt;apacherb&lt;/a&gt;.  It took the concept of the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.fngtps.com/2008/06/putting-the-pane-back-into-deployment&quot;&gt;passenger preference pane&lt;/a&gt; and applied it to any local directory (rather than specifically rails apps).  I&amp;#8217;d always meant to turn the utility into a &lt;a href=&quot;http://rubygems.org/&quot;&gt;gem&lt;/a&gt; but never quite got round to it.  Luckily, &lt;a href=&quot;http://interblah.net/&quot;&gt;James Adam&lt;/a&gt; moved the code to &lt;a href=&quot;http://github.com/lazyatom/hostess/tree/master&quot;&gt;github&lt;/a&gt;, tidied it a little (notably making it restart apache after a change), renamed it and gemifimibulated it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Install it with:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class=&quot;code shell&quot;&gt;
$ gem install hostess
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Executing it without any arguments will display some simple instructions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class=&quot;code shell&quot;&gt;
$ hostess
  Usage:
    hostess create domain directory - create a new virtual host
    hostess delete domain           - delete a virtual host
    hostess list                    - list hostess virtual hosts
    hostess help                    - this info
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You&amp;#8217;ll need to run it as &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sudo&quot;&gt;sudo&lt;/a&gt; as it writes the configuration into /etc/apache2 and restarts apache.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To create a domain pointing at a local directory, you&amp;#8217;d do something like:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class=&quot;code shell&quot;&gt;
$ sudo hostess create example.local ~/Sites/example.local/
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This will register the local domain (the .local suffix is a convention rather than a rule) using &lt;a href=&quot;http://developer.apple.com/opensource/dirservices/&quot;&gt;directory services&lt;/a&gt; and add the &lt;a href=&quot;http://httpd.apache.org/&quot;&gt;apache&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;http://httpd.apache.org/docs/1.3/vhosts/&quot;&gt;virtual host&lt;/a&gt;.  Open your browser and visit example.local to see your local site.  Good huh.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

        <title>Introducing Deliciolytics</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#8217;ve been playing around with this for a little while and although it doesn&amp;#8217;t do most of the stuff I&amp;#8217;d like I figure it&amp;#8217;s still worth allowing other people to use it: &lt;a href=&quot;http://deliciolytics.co.uk&quot;&gt;deliciolytics&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Its main purpose in life at the moment is to provide an aggregated feed of every bookmark in delicious for pages within your domain.  Feel free to go ahead and &lt;a href=&quot;http://deliciolytics.co.uk/domains/new&quot;&gt;add your own domain&lt;/a&gt;.  You&amp;#8217;ll need to have a &lt;a href=&quot;http://sitemaps.org&quot;&gt;sitemap&lt;/a&gt; and that sitemap will currently need to be at /sitemap.xml (it can be an index to actual sitemaps though).  After you add a domain it&amp;#8217;ll be in a pending state for up to five minutes before a task runs to &amp;#8216;normalise&amp;#8217; it.  After that you just have to wait until the task runs to download your urls (from the sitemap) and query delicious for any bookmarks against each of them.  This currently happens once every 24 hours.  Your best bet would be to subscribe to the bookmarks feed (click through to your domain and then through to bookmarks) and wait for the task to populate it with bookmarking goodness.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You could easily launch a DoS attack by automating the process of adding domains but it be great if you didn&amp;#8217;t.  Thanks.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

        <title>A Greasemonkey Script that inserts a Google Site Search form into every page</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;I often find myself wanting to use &lt;a href=&quot;http://google.com&quot;&gt;google&lt;/a&gt; to search within a site I&amp;#8217;m visiting.  My current method is to navigate to the search box in &lt;a href=&quot;http://firefox.com&quot;&gt;firefox&lt;/a&gt; (cmd-k) and type &amp;#8220;site:domain-of-site search-term&amp;#8221;.  That&amp;#8217;s a bit painful so I finally got around to creating a &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greasemonkey&quot;&gt;greasemonkey&lt;/a&gt; script to make it easier.  &lt;a href=&quot;http://userscripts.org/scripts/show/47192&quot;&gt;Install the script&lt;/a&gt; from the &lt;a href=&quot;http://userscripts.org&quot;&gt;userscripts&lt;/a&gt; site.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Once installed, you can hit ctrl-9 on any page (except google, that&amp;#8217;d be crazy) and a search form will appear at the top of the page ready for you to type into.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.flickr.com/photos/chrisjroos/3470172619/&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3536/3470172619_99f12d3ca9.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The simplest thing is to type your search term and tap enter to view the google results.  However, it&amp;#8217;s often useful to restrict your search to more than just the domain of the site (I might want to search for things I&amp;#8217;ve said in twitter, site:twitter.com/chrisroos, for example) so there&amp;#8217;s a drop down list of url components that you can use to restrict which areas of the site you want to search.  Pressing escape within any of the fields in the search form will hide it again.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A previous version of this script would display the search form at the top of each page all the time.  That didn&amp;#8217;t play nice with absolutely positioned elements already in the page though, hence my decision to only show it when you actually need it.  There&amp;#8217;s still work to do (one of the main problems is that the search form will currently be inserted into every frame on a page, including iframes) but I think it&amp;#8217;s useful enough to get out there.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

        <title>Rails 2.3 and the ability to update created_at, created_on, updated_at and updated_on timestamps</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;The timing of the &lt;a href=&quot;http://groups.google.com/group/rubyonrails-security/browse_thread/thread/1d2fb5dc524f9ff4&quot;&gt;automatically generated timestamps and attribute assignment in rails 2.3 security note&lt;/a&gt; &lt;sup class=&quot;footnote&quot; id=&quot;fnr1&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn1&quot;&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; was interesting to me because I&amp;#8217;d just spent a while really trying to get my head around &lt;a href=&quot;http://api.rubyonrails.org/classes/ActiveRecord/Base.html#M002226&quot;&gt;attr_accessible&lt;/a&gt; and  &lt;a href=&quot;http://api.rubyonrails.org/classes/ActiveRecord/Base.html#M002225&quot;&gt;attr_protected&lt;/a&gt; and the best way to test their effects in an app I was working on.  Although I intend to write about the testing separately, the conclusion I came to was that I wanted to test the behaviour (more specifically, I was interested in what I could/couldn&amp;#8217;t assign) of my objects and not that I was specifically using attr_accessible or attr_protected.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Reading Alex&amp;#8217;s post made me wonder whether the &lt;a href=&quot;http://rubyonrails.org/&quot;&gt;rails&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/API&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;caps&quot;&gt;API&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt; ever guaranteed that the timestamps would be readonly: If that was the case then I can see arguments for not wanting to test the behaviour of your objects (because you&amp;#8217;re essentially testing the framework itself).  I couldn&amp;#8217;t find any mention of whether they&amp;#8217;d specifically be readonly so chose to do a bit of digging.  I created a &lt;a href=&quot;http://chrisroos.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/scratch/rails_timestamps_test/&quot;&gt;script&lt;/a&gt; that allowed me to, with relative ease, run tests against rails apps created with different versions of rails.  Using this I was able to test the mass assignment of timestamps (created_at, created_on, updated_at and updated_on) against multiple versions of rails.  The conclusion I came to (and I&amp;#8217;d love for other people to replicate my experiment and prove/disprove my results) was that the created_at and created_on pair of attributes have always (at least as far back as rails 1.0.0) been assignable, while the updated_at and updated_on attributes have only recently become assignable.  While digging I managed to find the &lt;a href=&quot;https://rails.lighthouseapp.com/projects/8994/tickets/1612-cant-create-ar-models-with-custom-updated_xx-timestamp&quot;&gt;lighthouse ticket&lt;/a&gt; (#1612) that requested the ability to set the updated_* timestamps and the &lt;a href=&quot;http://github.com/rails/rails/commit/63aac338332a06d3c9e28dde7954679703ec7620&quot;&gt;rails commit&lt;/a&gt; that closed that ticket.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;replicating-my-experiment&quot;&gt;Replicating my experiment&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Get a copy of rails&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;pre class=&quot;code shell&quot;&gt;
  $ cd /path/to/code
  $ git clone git://github.com/rails/rails.git
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Create a &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.mysql.com/&quot;&gt;mysql&lt;/a&gt; database called rails_timestamps_test, and create a table within that database called people.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;pre class=&quot;code sql&quot;&gt;
  mysql&amp;gt; CREATE DATABASE rails_timestamps_test;
  mysql&amp;gt; USE rails_timestamps_test;
  mysql&amp;gt; CREATE TABLE people (id INTEGER AUTO_INCREMENT, created_on DATE, created_at DATETIME, updated_on DATE, updated_at DATETIME, PRIMARY KEY (id));
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Get a copy of my test script&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Run my script against rails 2.3 (run setup_rails_project.rb without any arguments to see the options) and hopefully see output similar to below (which means that the tests passed as expected).&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;If you specify a tag of rails that is anything other than a 3 part version number (e.g. the four part version 2.3.2.1, or the release candidate 2.1.0_RC1) then the version test will fail because the Rails::&lt;span class=&quot;caps&quot;&gt;VERSION&lt;/span&gt; constant only contains the &lt;span class=&quot;caps&quot;&gt;MAJOR&lt;/span&gt;, &lt;span class=&quot;caps&quot;&gt;MINOR&lt;/span&gt; and &lt;span class=&quot;caps&quot;&gt;TINY&lt;/span&gt; components and that&amp;#8217;s what we use to check the version our app uses.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;The supplied database.yml file assumes a mysql database running on localhost that has a root user with no password.  You can update this to reflect your actual environment.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;The projects are created in /path/to/code/rails_timestamps_test/projects/ with a name like rails-app-x-x-x (major, minor, tiny).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;In order to ensure we are testing against the correct version of rails, I symlink rails from /path/to/code/rails (after changing to the requested tag) into rails-app-x-x-x/vendor/rails.  The problem here is that if you re-run the script with a different rails version and then attempt to run a test from your first project that it will be using the recently specified version of rails.  Luckily, the rails_version_test will fail fast which means you shouldn&amp;#8217;t have to waste time wondering why something is not working as expected.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;I wonder whether it&amp;#8217;d be useful to extract the &amp;#8216;create a rails app from a specific version of rails&amp;#8217; functionality out of this script?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

        <title>Generating and Inserting a Rel=Canonical Link Into Pages With Firefox and Greasemonkey</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#8217;ve been &lt;a href=&quot;/blog/2007-12-14-web-pages-should-specify-their-canonical-url-permalink&quot;&gt;thinking about this for over a year&lt;/a&gt; but have only recently got around to doing something about it.  I&amp;#8217;ve also chosen to use &lt;a href=&quot;http://googlewebmastercentral.blogspot.com/2009/02/specify-your-canonical.html&quot;&gt;rel=canonical&lt;/a&gt; rather than rel=bookmark.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The magic is all in &lt;a href=&quot;http://userscripts.org/scripts/show/46797&quot;&gt;this&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/748&quot;&gt;greasemonkey&lt;/a&gt; script.  It uses little rule objects to generate the canonical urls for, at the moment, &lt;a href=&quot;http://ebay.co.uk&quot;&gt;ebay&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;http://google.co.uk&quot;&gt;google&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;http://theyworkforyou.com&quot;&gt;theyworkforyou&lt;/a&gt; and insert those urls into the page as a link element with rel=canonical.  Combining my script with the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.facesaerch.com/widget/showcanonical.user.js&quot;&gt;show canonical&lt;/a&gt; greasemonkey script (found on the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.tripwolf.com/en/blog/2009/03/17/offtopic-canonical-a-powerful-seo-concept/&quot;&gt;tripwolf blog&lt;/a&gt;) allows me to easily visit and use the canonical url in emails and the like.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You should just about be able to see the relatively short canonical url compared to the large url generated by my searching from the firefox search box.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.flickr.com/photos/chrisjroos/3440988983/&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3627/3440988983_1fe7b0518a_o.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I hope to expand the set of rules (if you wanted to create one right now I&amp;#8217;d suggest looking at the source of the script, the rules are defined towards the end of the script, and the &lt;a href=&quot;http://chrisroos.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/scratch/javascript-permalinks/test/rules/&quot;&gt;rule tests&lt;/a&gt;) and possible have some central repository of rules that the script could use.  If you know of some sites that you&amp;#8217;d like to see canonical urls for, but don&amp;#8217;t want to create the rule, then let me know and I&amp;#8217;ll see if I can create it for you.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

        <title>CruiseControlrb With Passenger and Launchd on a Mac</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;This has taken me ages, is quite fiddly and I&amp;#8217;m still not 100% happy with it but it seems to work well enough to document here.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Configuring the server to run under Passenger&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Buy a Mac.  Hmm, maybe that&amp;#8217;s starting a little too early in the process&amp;#8230;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Install &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.modrails.com/&quot;&gt;Passenger&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Download &lt;a href=&quot;http://cruisecontrolrb.thoughtworks.com/&quot;&gt;cruisecontrol.rb&lt;/a&gt; (from &lt;a href=&quot;http://github.com/thoughtworks/cruisecontrol.rb/tree/master&quot;&gt;github&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=&quot;http://rubyforge.org/projects/cruisecontrolrb/&quot;&gt;rubyforge&lt;/a&gt;).  We&amp;#8217;re using the version from &lt;a href=&quot;http://github.com/&quot;&gt;github&lt;/a&gt; as it has &lt;a href=&quot;http://git-scm.com/&quot;&gt;git&lt;/a&gt; support built in.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Edit the cruisecontrol.rb production environment (cc.rb/config/environments/production.rb) so that we can disable the builders by setting an environment variable.  By default, starting the server (even through Passenger) starts the builders too.  This doesn&amp;#8217;t work by default because the &lt;span class=&quot;caps&quot;&gt;PATH&lt;/span&gt; environment variable isn&amp;#8217;t set which means the builders can&amp;#8217;t find git.  Although it doesn&amp;#8217;t feel like entirely the right approach I actually wonder if I could use the ruby-wrapper-approach (detailed below) to have these builders work correctly.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;pre class=&quot;code diff&quot;&gt;
   config.after_initialize do
     require CRUISE_DATA_ROOT + &#39;/site_config&#39; if File.exists?(CRUISE_DATA_ROOT + &quot;/site_config.rb&quot;)
     require RAILS_ROOT + &#39;/config/dashboard_initialize&#39;
  -  BuilderStarter.start_builders
  +  BuilderStarter.start_builders unless ENV[&#39;CCRB_WITHOUT_BUILDERS&#39;]
   end
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Create a wrapper around &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.ruby-lang.org/&quot;&gt;ruby&lt;/a&gt; that allows us to pass environment variables to our Passenger apps.  I actually made the amendment to the code above before realising that it&amp;#8217;s not entirely trivial to pass environment variables from &lt;a href=&quot;http://httpd.apache.org/&quot;&gt;Apache&lt;/a&gt; to a Passenger app (&lt;a href=&quot;http://code.google.com/p/phusion-passenger/issues/detail?id=81&quot;&gt;this ticket&lt;/a&gt; details the problem).  I wasn&amp;#8217;t keen on the idea of this wrapper (&lt;a href=&quot;http://blog.phusion.nl/2008/12/16/passing-environment-variables-to-ruby-from-phusion-passenger/&quot;&gt;explanation on the phusion blog&lt;/a&gt;) at first but I ended up thinking it was the neatest solution.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;pre class=&quot;code shell&quot;&gt;
  $ cat &amp;gt; ~/ruby_for_passenger
  #!/bin/sh

  export CCRB_WITHOUT_BUILDERS=true

  exec &quot;/usr/bin/ruby&quot; &quot;$@&quot;

  $ sudo mv ~/ruby_for_passenger /usr/local/bin/
  $ sudo chmod +x /usr/local/bin/ruby_for_passenger
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Change the value of the PassengerRuby configuration option in your apache httpd config.  We need to tell Passenger to use our wrapper script instead of the default ruby binary it found during installation.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;pre class=&quot;code shell&quot;&gt;
  $ sudo vi /etc/apache2/httpd.conf
  #PassengerRuby /System/Library/Frameworks/Ruby.framework/Versions/1.8/usr/bin/ruby
  PassengerRuby /usr/local/bin/ruby_for_passenger
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Configure the passenger virtual host for your cruise instance.  I strongly recommend using the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.fngtps.com/passenger-preference-pane&quot;&gt;Passenger preference pane&lt;/a&gt; to do this (remember to set it to use the production environment).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Navigate to your chosen local domain and you should be presented with the default cruise web interface.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Configuring the builders to start under launchd&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Edit the cc.rb/script/builder file to set the default log directory to a path relative to the project root.  This is so that we can run the builders from a location other than within cc.rb and still have them log correctly (the default behaviour is that we receive a warning about a missing log directory and the log output is redirected to stdout).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;pre class=&quot;code diff&quot;&gt;
  -  CRUISE_OPTIONS[:log_file_name] = &quot;log/#{CRUISE_OPTIONS[:project_name]}_builder.log&quot;
  +  CRUISE_OPTIONS[:log_file_name] = File.join(RAILS_ROOT, &#39;log&#39;, &quot;#{CRUISE_OPTIONS[:project_name]}_builder.log&quot;)
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Create a &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Launchd&quot;&gt;launchd&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Property_list&quot;&gt;property list&lt;/a&gt; for each task.  I&amp;#8217;ve got mine in ~/Library/LaunchAgents/label-from-plist in the home directory of a user that has public key access to the git repository.  This is my one annoyance with this current solution: It requires the user mentioned above to be logged in.  I spent a very long time trying to get the builders working as &lt;a href=&quot;http://developer.apple.com/technotes/tn2005/tn2083.html#SECDAEMONS&quot;&gt;launch daemons&lt;/a&gt;, rather than &lt;a href=&quot;http://developer.apple.com/technotes/tn2005/tn2083.html#SECAGENTS&quot;&gt;agents&lt;/a&gt;, so that they would build without a user having to be logged in.  I was hoping to find an environment variable I could set so that git or &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Secure_Shell&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;caps&quot;&gt;SSH&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt; knew to use the public key from a user other than root (who the launch daemons run as) but didn&amp;#8217;t have any such luck.  If anyone has any ideas about this I&amp;#8217;d love to hear them.  &lt;strong&gt;Note&lt;/strong&gt; Although I haven&amp;#8217;t tried it, I suspect that it&amp;#8217;d be trivial to get non-public-key subversion builders to run as daemons.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;pre class=&quot;code xml&quot;&gt;
  &amp;lt;?xml version=&quot;1.0&quot; encoding=&quot;UTF-8&quot;?&amp;gt;
  &amp;lt;!DOCTYPE plist PUBLIC &quot;-//Apple//DTD PLIST 1.0//EN&quot; &quot;http://www.apple.com/DTDs/PropertyList-1.0.dtd&quot;&amp;gt;
  &amp;lt;plist version=&quot;1.0&quot;&amp;gt;
    &amp;lt;dict&amp;gt;
      &amp;lt;key&amp;gt;EnvironmentVariables&amp;lt;/key&amp;gt;
      &amp;lt;dict&amp;gt;
        &amp;lt;key&amp;gt;PATH&amp;lt;/key&amp;gt;
        &amp;lt;string&amp;gt;/usr/bin:/opt/local/bin&amp;lt;/string&amp;gt;
      &amp;lt;/dict&amp;gt;
      &amp;lt;key&amp;gt;Label&amp;lt;/key&amp;gt;
      &amp;lt;string&amp;gt;label-describing-your-builder&amp;lt;/string&amp;gt;
      &amp;lt;key&amp;gt;ProgramArguments&amp;lt;/key&amp;gt;
      &amp;lt;array&amp;gt;
        &amp;lt;string&amp;gt;/Users/chrisroos/cruisecontrol.rb/cruise&amp;lt;/string&amp;gt;
        &amp;lt;string&amp;gt;build&amp;lt;/string&amp;gt;
        &amp;lt;string&amp;gt;name-of-project-to-build&amp;lt;/string&amp;gt;
      &amp;lt;/array&amp;gt;
      &amp;lt;key&amp;gt;RunAtLoad&amp;lt;/key&amp;gt;
      &amp;lt;true/&amp;gt;
    &amp;lt;/dict&amp;gt;
  &amp;lt;/plist&amp;gt;

  # Notes:
  # We set the PATH environment variable so that both git and ruby can be found.
  #¬†We set RunAtLoad so that as soon as the plist is loaded by launchctl it will start to run.
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Load the agent using &lt;a href=&quot;http://developer.apple.com/DOCUMENTATION/DARWIN/Reference/ManPages/man1/launchctl.1.html&quot;&gt;launchctl&lt;/a&gt; as the user named above (i.e. not root).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;pre class=&quot;code shell&quot;&gt;
  $ launchctl load ~/Library/LaunchAgents/label-from-plist
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And that should be about it.  I&amp;#8217;d appreciate any feedback anyone has about this approach and to hear about alternative approaches of getting cruise running automatically on system boot.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

        <title>Installing Passenger 2.1.2 on CentOS 5.2</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;I needed to upgrade &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.modrails.com/&quot;&gt;Passenger&lt;/a&gt; on our web server last week (so that we could run &lt;a href=&quot;http://rubyonrails.org/&quot;&gt;Rails&lt;/a&gt; 2.3 apps) but ran into a little problem getting it installed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We&amp;#8217;re running &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.centos.org/&quot;&gt;CentOS&lt;/a&gt; 5.2 on our staging server.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class=&quot;code shell&quot;&gt;
  [root@rails-staging0 ~]# cat /etc/redhat-release
  CentOS release 5.2 (Final)
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The passenger gem installed OK but when I ran passenger-install-apache2-module I got the following error.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class=&quot;code shell&quot;&gt;
  ... other lines snipped ...

  /usr/bin/ld: skipping incompatible /usr/lib/libaprutil-1.so when searching for -laprutil-1
  /usr/bin/ld: cannot find -laprutil-1
  collect2: ld returned 1 exit status
  rake aborted!
  Command failed with status (1): [g++ -shared SystemTime.o Utils.o Bucket.o ...]
  /var/ruby-enterprise-1.8.6-20080810/lib/ruby/gems/1.8/gems/passenger-2.1.2/Rakefile:157
  (See full trace by running task with --trace)

  --------------------------------------------
  It looks like something went wrong
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Searching for this error didn&amp;#8217;t yield any definite fixes but a couple of posts mentioned re-installing the apr-devel packages.  I tried apr-devel to begin with but was told that it was already up-to-date.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class=&quot;code shell&quot;&gt;
  [root@rails-staging0 ~]# yum install apr-devel
  ... other lines snipped ...
  Nothing to do
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I can&amp;#8217;t remember why but I tried apr-util-devel next which did result in the package being installed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class=&quot;code shell&quot;&gt;
  [root@rails-staging0 ~]# yum install apr-util-devel
  ... other lines snipped ...
  Installed: apr-util-devel.x86_64 0:1.2.7-7.el5
  Complete!
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With this package re-installed I was able to go ahead and install the passenger apache module (i.e. passenger-install-apache2-module succeeded).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One slightly interesting/odd thing was that &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yellow_dog_Updater,_Modified&quot;&gt;yum&lt;/a&gt; reported that the same version (1.2.7-7.el5) of apr-util-dev was already installed.  The only difference after the re-install was that its status changed from &amp;#8216;base&amp;#8217; to &amp;#8216;installed&amp;#8217;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class=&quot;code shell&quot;&gt;
  # before the re-install
  [root@rails-staging0 ~]# yum list | grep apr-util-devel
  apr-util-devel.x86_64                    1.2.7-7.el5            base

  # after the re-install
  [root@rails-staging0 ~]# yum list | grep apr-util-devel
  apr-util-devel.x86_64                    1.2.7-7.el5            installed
&lt;/pre&gt;</description>

        <title>Hack the Government Day (Rewired State)</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://coupde.com/&quot;&gt;James Darling&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.memespring.co.uk/&quot;&gt;Richard Pope&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.emmamulqueeny.com/&quot;&gt;Emma Mulqueeny&lt;/a&gt; organised the excellent &lt;a href=&quot;http://rewiredstate.org/&quot;&gt;Rewired State&lt;/a&gt; on Saturday (7th March) at the new &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.guardian.co.uk/&quot;&gt;Guardian&lt;/a&gt; offices in Kings Cross.  The idea behind rewiredstate was pretty simple (from rewiredstate.org):&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;bq.&lt;br /&gt;
  Government isn&amp;#8217;t very good at computers.&lt;br /&gt;
  They spend millions to produce mediocre websites, hide away really useful public information and generally get it wrong. Which is a shame.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I had a plan for the day.  It&amp;#8217;s a plan I&amp;#8217;d had for about a year or so and it involved the atrocity that is &lt;a href=&quot;http://activeplaces.com/&quot;&gt;Active Places&lt;/a&gt; (a &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.sportengland.org/&quot;&gt;Sport England&lt;/a&gt; funded project).  It&amp;#8217;s really hard to find information about sports facilities (I was specifically interested in public swimming pools) in the UK.  I know this because I&amp;#8217;ve tried to find public swimming pools that are either near where I stay (when in London), easily accessible from a station on the commute, or near work.  At the moment that involves finding and searching the websites of each of the councils whose boundaries I cross or am near.  This is certainly not ideal.  It&amp;#8217;s more frustrating because the government have this information locked up (the entire site requires cookies so there&amp;#8217;s no chance of it appearing in google) in activeplaces.  Oh, and there&amp;#8217;s another little gem of information: &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.theyworkforyou.com/wrans/?id=2005-06-13b.3605.h&quot;&gt;activeplaces cost ¬£5.2 million over three years&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Before the event on Saturday, I spent quite a while scraping the data out of activeplaces.  This involved issuing a search for each of the postcode outcodes in England (I thought I had this postcode data for the UK but apparently didn&amp;#8217;t) and parsing the search results to get a unique list of sports centres.  I could then download the relevant site, and facility (which is in separate pages and displayed through an iframe on the main site page), information for each centre.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On the day I was lucky enough to get help from &lt;a href=&quot;http://lazyatom.com/&quot;&gt;James Adam&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;http://jamesandre.ws/&quot;&gt;James Andrews&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;http://tomtaylor.co.uk/&quot;&gt;Tom Taylor&lt;/a&gt; to work on the &lt;a href=&quot;http://projects.rewiredstate.org/projects/active-places&quot;&gt;active places project&lt;/a&gt;.  I had a rough plan to &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geocoding&quot;&gt;geocode&lt;/a&gt; the sports facility data we had, parse the downloaded site data to extract the access type of the facility (i.e. private membership or publicly accessible) and create a simple alternative to activeplaces.  Tom helped me geocode the data (using &lt;a href=&quot;http://graticule.rubyforge.org/graticule/&quot;&gt;graticule&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.multimap.com/openapi/&quot;&gt;multimap api&lt;/a&gt;), while James Adam parsed the access type and James Andrews worked on the &lt;a href=&quot;http://github.com/ja/activeplaces/tree/master&quot;&gt;site&lt;/a&gt;.  The geocoded data made it incredibly easy to produce a &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Keyhole_Markup_Language&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;caps&quot;&gt;KML&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt; file of sites that Tom could consume in his excellent &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.iamnear.net/&quot;&gt;I am near&lt;/a&gt; service (&lt;a href=&quot;http://swimmingpools.iamnear.net/&quot;&gt;swimming pools I am near&lt;/a&gt;).  At the last minute I put together a very simple &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.sinatrarb.com/&quot;&gt;sinatra&lt;/a&gt; webservice that allows for the querying of the activeplaces data (by facility and access type) and returns the data in kml (&lt;a href=&quot;http://chrisroos.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/scratch/public-swimming-pools.co.uk&quot;&gt;source&lt;/a&gt;).  You can plug the url of this kml file directly into &lt;a href=&quot;http://maps.google.co.uk&quot;&gt;google maps&lt;/a&gt; or download it and plug it into &lt;a href=&quot;http://earth.google.com/&quot;&gt;google earth&lt;/a&gt;.  All that was left was to present (&amp;#8216;slides&amp;#8217; are on &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.flickr.com/photos/chrisjroos/sets/72157614969161427/&quot;&gt;flickr&lt;/a&gt;) what we&amp;#8217;d done (in just two minutes) and go to the pub.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;embed src=&quot;http://blip.tv/play/AfHWWAA&quot; type=&quot;application/x-shockwave-flash&quot; width=&quot;640&quot; height=&quot;510&quot; allowscriptaccess=&quot;always&quot; allowfullscreen=&quot;true&quot;&gt;&lt;/embed&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There was a chap from &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.direct.gov.uk&quot;&gt;DirectGov&lt;/a&gt; at the event and he mentioned that he was interested in us continuing the work we&amp;#8217;d started.  I&amp;#8217;ve also spoken to someone from &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.london2012.com/&quot;&gt;London 2012&lt;/a&gt; as it sounds like they&amp;#8217;re aiming to do something similar.  So, not only was it a great day but there&amp;#8217;s a chance that we might be able to help shape some of the stuff that the government plans to work on.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

        <title>Posting Bookmarks to Delicious From My Android G1</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;For a while I&amp;#8217;ve wanted the ability to bookmark pages in &lt;a href=&quot;http://delicious.com&quot;&gt;delicious&lt;/a&gt; from my &lt;a href=&quot;http://code.google.com/android/&quot;&gt;Android&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.t-mobileg1.com/&quot;&gt;G1&lt;/a&gt;.  After a few weeks of occasionally looking to see if anyone had done the work for me I started to investigate building an Android app.  I got about as far as reading through some of the tutorials but never seemed to find the time to really get stuck in.  In the meantime, to get around the limitations of the client side only bookmarks on the G1, I would save a draft email containing the &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uniform_Resource_Locator&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;caps&quot;&gt;URL&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt; of the page I was interested in and later open it on a desktop machine and post to delicious.  Saving a draft is fairly trivial in that you visit a page in the browser, hit the share menu item, choose &lt;a href=&quot;http://mail.google.com&quot;&gt;gmail&lt;/a&gt; and hit save draft (sharing via gmail pastes the &lt;span class=&quot;caps&quot;&gt;URL&lt;/span&gt; of the current page into the body of the email) but the whole process was a bit cumbersome.  I think it was about a week ago when I realised that I should just be able to email my bookmarks to delicious directly.  A little searching appeared to suggest that there was nothing to let me do this&lt;sup class=&quot;footnote&quot; id=&quot;fnr1&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn1&quot;&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; so I went about hooking a few things together in order to get the functionality I was after.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have recently discovered just how simple and powerful &lt;a href=&quot;http://rack.rubyforge.org/&quot;&gt;rack&lt;/a&gt; is, especially when combined with &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.modrails.com/&quot;&gt;Phusion Passenger&lt;/a&gt; (which makes it stupidly easy to deploy rack apps).  It seemed ideal for the job.  Combine that with &lt;a href=&quot;http://smtp2web.com/&quot;&gt;smtp2web&lt;/a&gt; (I recently rediscovered this after catching up on all the &lt;a href=&quot;http://blog.webhooks.org/&quot;&gt;webhook&lt;/a&gt; buzz that seems to be doing the rounds) and a little bit of &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.ruby-lang.org/en/&quot;&gt;ruby&lt;/a&gt; to talk to delicious and I had everything I needed.  So, I spent an hour or so last night getting a little end to end proof of concept up and running.  Happy that I could hook all the components together I spent a further two or three hours tidying everything up and getting an app together (&lt;a href=&quot;http://chrisroos.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/scratch/mail-to-delicious/&quot;&gt;source in google code&lt;/a&gt;) that I could deploy to my &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.exonetric.com/&quot;&gt;exonetric&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virtual_private_server&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;caps&quot;&gt;VPS&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.  I was even able to use the service for real on the train this morning.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Feel free to deploy the code to your own server (or the awesome &lt;a href=&quot;http://heroku.com/&quot;&gt;heroku&lt;/a&gt;) if you wish to post bookmarks to your own account.  You&amp;#8217;ll need to copy config/delicious.yml.example to config/delicious.yml and enter your delicious credentials.  The email parser expects to get the bookmark title in the subject line of the email (required), the &lt;span class=&quot;caps&quot;&gt;URL&lt;/span&gt; on the first line of the email body (required) and tags on a line in the body beginning with T (i.e. /^T (.*)/).  The rest of the body is treated as the notes.  I was originally going to see if there was any interest in a hosted service whereby you register your delicious credentials and receive a secret email address to use in order to post to delicious.  It seems that ping.fm already has this covered so I&amp;#8217;m not going to worry about hosting it for anyone but me.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I love how relatively easy it is to hook these things together, in a short period of time, to produce something useful.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Note&lt;/strong&gt;.  I searched again for android delicious clients just before I started writing this post and was slightly surprised to see that there are now two apps that offer this functionality: &lt;a href=&quot;http://code.google.com/p/android-delicious-bookmarks/&quot;&gt;Android delicious bookmarks&lt;/a&gt; and Beelicious (for which I couldn&amp;#8217;t find a link).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;footnote&quot; id=&quot;fn1&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fnr1&quot;&gt;&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/a&gt; Having just repeated the search I found &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.labnol.org/internet/post-links-to-delicious-via-email-mobile/4470/&quot;&gt;this post&lt;/a&gt; that suggests using &lt;a href=&quot;http://ping.fm&quot;&gt;ping.fm&lt;/a&gt; to do exactly what I&amp;#8217;m after.  Oh well.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

        <title>Gracefully Degrade the Google Custom Search Form So That It Works Without Javascript</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;It struck me a couple of nights ago that it wasn&amp;#8217;t possible to search my site without Javascript, because of &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.google.com/coop/cse/&quot;&gt;Google Custom Search&amp;#8217;s&lt;/a&gt; reliance on &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JavaScript&quot;&gt;Javascript&lt;/a&gt;.  I&amp;#8217;m not sure whether I just overlooked the fact or whether I&amp;#8217;d realised that it was bad and ignored it.  Either way, I decided it was time to do something about it.  I stripped out the google custom search form and replaced it with a form that actually searches the google index of my site.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class=&quot;code html&quot;&gt;
&amp;lt;form action=&#39;http://www.google.co.uk/search&#39; id=&#39;searchForm&#39;&amp;gt;
  &amp;lt;div&amp;gt;
    &amp;lt;input name=&#39;q&#39; type=&#39;hidden&#39; value=&#39;site:chrisroos.co.uk&#39; /&amp;gt;
    &amp;lt;input name=&#39;q&#39; size=&#39;31&#39; type=&#39;text&#39; /&amp;gt;
    &amp;lt;input name=&#39;sa&#39; type=&#39;submit&#39; value=&#39;Search&#39; /&amp;gt;
  &amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;/form&amp;gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, the default behaviour (with javascript disabled) is now to search the content of my site in the google index.  I then use &lt;a href=&quot;http://chrisroos.co.uk/javascripts/google-custom-search.js&quot;&gt;javascript&lt;/a&gt; to &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Progressive_enhancement&quot;&gt;progressively enhance&lt;/a&gt; the form to make it compatible with the google custom search.  Done.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class=&quot;code javascript&quot;&gt;
var googleCustomSearch = {
  createHiddenField : function(name, value) {
    var field = document.createElement(&#39;input&#39;);
    field.setAttribute(&#39;type&#39;, &#39;hidden&#39;);
    field.setAttribute(&#39;name&#39;, name);
    field.setAttribute(&#39;value&#39;, value);
    return field;
  },
  addHiddenField : function(form, name, value) {
    var field = this.createHiddenField(name, value);
    form.appendChild(field);
  },
  removeUnnecessaryField : function(form) {
    var elems = form.getElementsByTagName(&#39;input&#39;);
    for (var i = 0; i &amp;lt; elems.length; i++) {
      var elem = elems[i];
      if (elem.getAttribute(&#39;value&#39;) == &#39;site:chrisroos.co.uk&#39;) {
        elem.parentNode.removeChild(elem);
      }
    };
  },
  setupForm : function(form) {
    form.setAttribute(&#39;action&#39;, &#39;/search&#39;);
    form.setAttribute(&#39;id&#39;, &#39;cse-search-box&#39;);
  },
  loadGoogleCustomSearchJavascript : function() {
    var externalScript = document.createElement(&#39;script&#39;);
    externalScript.setAttribute(&#39;type&#39;, &#39;text/javascript&#39;);
    externalScript.setAttribute(&#39;src&#39;, &#39;http://www.google.com/coop/cse/brand?form=cse-search-box&amp;amp;amp;lang=en&#39;);
    document.body.appendChild(externalScript);
  },
  init : function() {
    var searchForm = document.getElementById(&#39;searchForm&#39;);
    if (searchForm) {
      this.setupForm(searchForm);
      this.removeUnnecessaryField(searchForm);
      this.addHiddenField(searchForm, &#39;cx&#39;, &#39;017216692514631406866:xbxiffq7rno&#39;);
      this.addHiddenField(searchForm, &#39;cof&#39;, &#39;FORID:9&#39;);
      this.addHiddenField(searchForm, &#39;ie&#39;, &#39;UTF-8&#39;);
      this.loadGoogleCustomSearchJavascript();
    }
  }
}
googleCustomSearch.init();
&lt;/pre&gt;</description>

        <title>Keyboard Shortcuts for the Link Widgets Firefox Extension</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#8217;m posting this because I couldn&amp;#8217;t find the keyboard shortcuts listed anywhere and ended up having to dig into the source of the &lt;a href=&quot;https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/2933&quot;&gt;Link Widgets&lt;/a&gt; extension to find them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;First &amp;#8211; Shift + Alt + Page Up&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Previous &amp;#8211; Alt + Page Up&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Next &amp;#8211; Alt + Page Down&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Last &amp;#8211; Shift + Alt + Page Down&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Up a level &amp;#8211; Alt + Up&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Up to root level &amp;#8211; Shift + Alt + Up&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These certainly work on the Mac.  There are another set of shortcuts that make use of the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.mozilla.org/unix/customizing.html#keys&quot;&gt;accel key&lt;/a&gt; but I didn&amp;#8217;t play around trying to get them to work.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;First &amp;#8211; Shift + Accel + ,&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Previous &amp;#8211; Accel + ,&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Next &amp;#8211; Accel + .&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Last &amp;#8211; Shift + Accel + .&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;</description>

        <title>Please Publish Full Content in Your RSS and Atom Feeds</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;Just a polite request to those that publish only partial content in their feeds.  Please don&amp;#8217;t do it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I used to read my feeds offline in &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.google.com/reader&quot;&gt;Google Reader&lt;/a&gt;.  Partial feeds are frustrating because they suck me in with a teaser and then leave me hanging until I get back to an Internet connection: where I&amp;#8217;ll often forget about the feed and leave it forever.  Alternatively, I&amp;#8217;ll visit said page offline, bookmark it in delicious (&lt;a href=&quot;https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/3615&quot;&gt;firefox extension&lt;/a&gt;) with a to-read tag and still never read it&lt;sup class=&quot;footnote&quot; id=&quot;fnr1&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn1&quot;&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I now tend to read feeds on my &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.t-mobileg1.com/&quot;&gt;G1&lt;/a&gt; (still in Google Reader).  Switching between interfaces on the G1 isn&amp;#8217;t quite as seamless as switching between tabs in a browser: It disrupts my flow.  I think the same argument applies to google reader in a standard browser: I&amp;#8217;m happily reading things that look the same until I come across some partial content, click a link and go blind because someone&amp;#8217;s decided that white on black in easy to read.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So there you have it.  The evidence&lt;sup class=&quot;footnote&quot; id=&quot;fnr2&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn2&quot;&gt;2&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; supports the fact that you should publish full content in your feeds.  Now go do it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;footnote&quot; id=&quot;fn1&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fnr1&quot;&gt;&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/a&gt; This is worse because I end up with a whole bunch of bookmarks that say &amp;#8216;page could not be loaded&amp;#8217;, or similar, and I then have to worry about fixing them up to make them pretty (I&amp;#8217;ve been doing this for over a year so just imagine how heavy this is on my shoulders right now).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;footnote&quot; id=&quot;fn2&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fnr2&quot;&gt;&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/a&gt; Fact.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

        <title>Idea - Web Services Could Publish Stats About the Clients That Connect to Them</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#8217;s not always obvious whether a client library is still compatible with the web service it was developed for.  I&amp;#8217;ve seen this before with &lt;a href=&quot;http://flickr.com&quot;&gt;flickr&lt;/a&gt; libraries and came across it again a couple of weeks ago when playing around with &lt;a href=&quot;http://aws.amazon.com/simpledb/&quot;&gt;Amazon Simple DB&lt;/a&gt;.  I found three (although there are more) &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.ruby-lang.org/en/&quot;&gt;ruby&lt;/a&gt; clients that supposedly connected to the Amazon Simple Db service: &lt;a href=&quot;http://nytimes.rubyforge.org/amazon_sdb/&quot;&gt;NY Times&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;http://rubyforge.org/projects/aws-sdb/&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;caps&quot;&gt;AWS&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;caps&quot;&gt;SDB&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;http://rubyforge.org/projects/rightaws/&quot;&gt;Right &lt;span class=&quot;caps&quot;&gt;AWS&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.  Unfortunately, without trying them (which, granted, wouldn&amp;#8217;t have taken too long) I had no idea whether they were going to work or do what I needed.  The fact that none of them appeared to support the latest version of the &lt;a href=&quot;/blog/2009-01-31-implementing-version-2-of-the-amazon-aws-http-request-signature-in-ruby&quot;&gt;request signing protocol&lt;/a&gt; made me question how useful they&amp;#8217;d be.  It struck me that it should be possible for the web service to know which client is being used to connect assuming the client supplies some sensible identifiable information (in the user agent http header for example).  If the provider was to publish this information (cient name/version, total requests, date of last request and probably some other useful info) then it should be possible to see which libraries still work with the web service.  Does anyone do this?  Does it actually sound like a sensible idea?&lt;/p&gt;</description>

        <title>Free Technical Books for Anyone That's Interested</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#8217;ve tried to sell these books on the Amazon marketplace multiple times in the past.  Although I&amp;#8217;ve managed to sell some through Amazon, usually at a loss, these ones just haven&amp;#8217;t gone.  I don&amp;#8217;t want them, I&amp;#8217;m not going to throw them and I&amp;#8217;d rather someone had them if they were going to be useful.  So, if you see something you want &lt;a href=&quot;mailto:chris@seagul.co.uk&quot;&gt;email me&lt;/a&gt;, pop something useful in the subject line and it&amp;#8217;s yours.  Oh, I&amp;#8217;ll need you to cover the cost of postage, which for these sort of books is going to be around ¬£6 (give or take) by paypal (or possibly something else if it&amp;#8217;s easy).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They&amp;#8217;re all in good/great condition apart from the Beginning Visual C# book which is the only one I&amp;#8217;ve really read properly.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Test Data for Version 2 of the Amazon Web Services Signing Protocol</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;This sort of data would have been incredibly handy when I was &lt;a href=&quot;/blog/2009-01-31-implementing-version-2-of-the-amazon-aws-http-request-signature-in-ruby&quot;&gt;trying to implement&lt;/a&gt; the &lt;a href=&quot;http://docs.amazonwebservices.com/AmazonSimpleDB/2007-11-07/DeveloperGuide/REST_RESTAuth.html&quot;&gt;Amazon request signing functionality&lt;/a&gt;.  It might be of use to anyone else that wants to implement it in another language.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I chose to test using the &lt;a href=&quot;http://docs.amazonwebservices.com/AmazonSimpleDB/2007-11-07/DeveloperGuide/SDB_API_ListDomains.html&quot;&gt;List domains&lt;/a&gt; method as it seemed fairly straightforward.  These are request parameters I used (you&amp;#8217;ll obviously need to use the exact same values when testing your implementation).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class=&quot;code&quot;&gt;
AWSAccessKeyId = access
Action = ListDomains
SignatureMethod = HmacSHA256
SignatureVersion = 2
Timestamp = 2009-02-01T12:53:20+00:00
Version = 2007-11-07
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The following numbered steps correspond to the numbered steps in the &lt;a href=&quot;http://docs.amazonwebservices.com/AmazonSimpleDB/2007-11-07/DeveloperGuide/REST_RESTAuth.html&quot;&gt;Authenticating &lt;span class=&quot;caps&quot;&gt;REST&lt;/span&gt; Requests&lt;/a&gt; part of the &lt;a href=&quot;http://docs.amazonwebservices.com/AmazonSimpleDB/2007-11-07/DeveloperGuide&quot;&gt;Amazon Simple DB developer guide&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;1. We &lt;span class=&quot;caps&quot;&gt;URL&lt;/span&gt; encode the above request parameters (the key value pairs) and sort them to generate this &amp;#8216;canonicalized query string&amp;#8217;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class=&quot;code&quot;&gt;
AWSAccessKeyId=access&amp;amp;Action=ListDomains&amp;amp;SignatureMethod=HmacSHA256&amp;amp;SignatureVersion=2&amp;amp;Timestamp=2009-02-01T12%3A53%3A20%2B00%3A00&amp;amp;Version=2007-11-07
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;2. We use this canonicalized query string within this string that we&amp;#8217;re going to hash.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class=&quot;code&quot;&gt;
GET
sdb.amazonaws.com
/
AWSAccessKeyId=access&amp;amp;Action=ListDomains&amp;amp;SignatureMethod=HmacSHA256&amp;amp;SignatureVersion=2&amp;amp;Timestamp=2009-02-01T12%3A53%3A20%2B00%3A00&amp;amp;Version=2007-11-07
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;3 and 4. We generate the following, &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Base64&quot;&gt;base64&lt;/a&gt; encoded, &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HMAC&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;caps&quot;&gt;HMAC&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt; of the string above using the SHA256 hashing algorithm and a secret key of &amp;#8216;secret&amp;#8217;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class=&quot;code&quot;&gt;
okj96/5ucWBSc1uR2zXVfm6mDHtgfNv657rRtt/aunQ=
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;5. We &lt;span class=&quot;caps&quot;&gt;URL&lt;/span&gt; encode this signature and add it to the list of request parameters (note that the order of the request parameters doesn&amp;#8217;t matter for the request itself).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class=&quot;code&quot;&gt;
Action=ListDomains&amp;amp;Signature=okj96%2F5ucWBSc1uR2zXVfm6mDHtgfNv657rRtt%2FaunQ%3D&amp;amp;Version=2007-11-07&amp;amp;AWSAccessKeyId=access&amp;amp;Timestamp=2009-02-01T12%3A53%3A20%2B00%3A00&amp;amp;SignatureVersion=2&amp;amp;SignatureMethod=HmacSHA256
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Once you&amp;#8217;re happy that you&amp;#8217;ve implemented the request signing functionality correctly you can use your real security credentials (access and secret keys) and test using &lt;a href=&quot;http://curl.haxx.se/&quot;&gt;curl&lt;/a&gt;.  Note that the &lt;span class=&quot;caps&quot;&gt;HTTP&lt;/span&gt; method, sdb host (sdb.amazonaws.com) and path (/) must match those that were used in the string that we hashed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class=&quot;code&quot;&gt;
curl -X&quot;GET&quot; &quot;https://sdb.amazonaws.com/?Action=ListDomains&amp;amp;Signature=okj96%2F5ucWBSc1uR2zXVfm6mDHtgfNv657rRtt%2FaunQ%3D&amp;amp;Version=2007-11-07&amp;amp;AWSAccessKeyId=access&amp;amp;Timestamp=2009-02-01T12%3A53%3A20%2B00%3A00&amp;amp;SignatureVersion=2&amp;amp;SignatureMethod=HmacSHA256&quot;
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That should be it.  It possibly would&amp;#8217;ve made more sense to generate these as tests using &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.ruby-doc.org/stdlib/libdoc/test/unit/rdoc/&quot;&gt;test/unit&lt;/a&gt; so that you could easily convert them to the &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/XUnit&quot;&gt;xunit&lt;/a&gt; tool of your choice before implementing your solution.  Actually, what I believe would have made sense was for Amazon to release such a set of tests themselves.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

        <title>Implementing Version 2 of the Amazon AWS HTTP Request Signature in Ruby</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;This took me a long time to work out this afternoon so I guess it might be useful to others.  I couldn&amp;#8217;t find an implementation (of version 2 of the request signing) in any of the existing Amazon &lt;span class=&quot;caps&quot;&gt;AWS&lt;/span&gt; libraries and although I did find a promising looking post &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.jamesmurty.com/2008/12/31/aws-query-signature-version-2/&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt; it just didn&amp;#8217;t work for me.  I ended up using the &lt;a href=&quot;http://developer.amazonwebservices.com/connect/entry.jspa?externalID=1135&quot;&gt;Simple DB &lt;span class=&quot;caps&quot;&gt;PHP&lt;/span&gt; sample code&lt;/a&gt; to obtain some test data&lt;sup class=&quot;footnote&quot; id=&quot;fnr1&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn1&quot;&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; that I could use to debug my own code&lt;sup class=&quot;footnote&quot; id=&quot;fnr2&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn2&quot;&gt;2&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; and eventually got it working.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;footnote&quot; id=&quot;fn1&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fnr1&quot;&gt;&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/a&gt; I plan to post some test data (to help others attempting to write a client) in a follow up post.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;footnote&quot; id=&quot;fn2&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fnr2&quot;&gt;&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/a&gt; I printed the parameters and signature at various stages of the request so that I could compare it to the output from my client.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class=&quot;code&quot;&gt;
require &#39;rubygems&#39;
require &#39;cgi&#39;
require &#39;time&#39;
require &#39;hmac&#39;
require &#39;hmac-sha2&#39;
require &#39;base64&#39;

ACCESS_IDENTIFIER = &#39;your-access-identifier&#39;
SECRET_IDENTIFIER = &#39;your-secret-identifier&#39;

AMAZON_ENDPOINT = &#39;https://sdb.amazonaws.com/&#39;

params = {
  &#39;Action&#39; =&amp;gt; &#39;ListDomains&#39;,
  &#39;AWSAccessKeyId&#39; =&amp;gt; ACCESS_IDENTIFIER,
  &#39;SignatureMethod&#39; =&amp;gt; &#39;HmacSHA256&#39;,
  &#39;SignatureVersion&#39; =&amp;gt; 2,
  &#39;Timestamp&#39; =&amp;gt; Time.now.iso8601,
  &#39;Version&#39; =&amp;gt; &#39;2007-11-07&#39;
}

canonical_querystring = params.sort.collect { |key, value| [CGI.escape(key.to_s), CGI.escape(value.to_s)].join(&#39;=&#39;) }.join(&#39;&amp;amp;&#39;)
string_to_sign = &quot;GET
sdb.amazonaws.com
/
#{canonical_querystring}&quot;

hmac = HMAC::SHA256.new(SECRET_IDENTIFIER)
hmac.update(string_to_sign)
signature = Base64.encode64(hmac.digest).chomp # chomp is important!  the base64 encoded version will have a newline at the end

params[&#39;Signature&#39;] = signature
querystring = params.collect { |key, value| [CGI.escape(key.to_s), CGI.escape(value.to_s)].join(&#39;=&#39;) }.join(&#39;&amp;amp;&#39;) # order doesn&#39;t matter for the actual request

puts `curl -X&quot;GET&quot; &quot;#{AMAZON_ENDPOINT}?#{querystring}&quot; -A&quot;simple ruby aws sdb wrapper&quot;`
&lt;/pre&gt;</description>

        <title>Turning Off My National Rail Twitter Bot</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;This actually happened nearly a year ago but I&amp;#8217;ve only just got around to writing it up (I occasionally still get people following the natrailenq twitter user which prompted me to get this written).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I first wrote about a &lt;a href=&quot;/blog/2007-07-24-train-times-by-sms-or-improving-national-rail-enquiries&quot;&gt;national rail twitter bot&lt;/a&gt; in July 2007 and then again in &lt;a href=&quot;/blog/2008-02-28-national-rail-train-times-by-sms-again&quot;&gt;February 2008&lt;/a&gt;.  The premise was simple: you follow natrailenq on &lt;a href=&quot;http://twitter.com&quot;&gt;twitter&lt;/a&gt;, send a direct message in a certain format and you&amp;#8217;d get a list of train departure and arrival times.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Unfortunately, I received an email towards the end of Feb 2008 asking me to turn the service off because it contravened the &lt;a href=&quot;http://nationalrail.co.uk/contact/tandc/&quot;&gt;terms and conditions&lt;/a&gt; on the &lt;a href=&quot;http://nationalrail.co.uk&quot;&gt;national rail&lt;/a&gt; website.  Oh well, it was fun while it lasted.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;emailBody&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Chris,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Just came across your blog and the integration work that you‚Äôve done with Twitter and our website.  Unfortunately our terms and conditions prohibit the use of our site in the manner you are using it and I have to ask you to stop, close down and remove any software of yours that uses information from nationalrial.co.uk.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Many thanks,&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Lloyds TSB Stole My Money (Kinda)</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;I received a letter dated the 21st January to state that I&amp;#8217;d tried to make a transfer, on that day, and that I didn&amp;#8217;t have the funds to cover it.  Lloyds &lt;span class=&quot;caps&quot;&gt;TSB&lt;/span&gt; earned themselves ¬£20 out of the matter (I guess stealing is cheaper than physically printing the money).  I&amp;#8217;m willing to take some of the responsibility but at the same time I find the Lloyds &lt;span class=&quot;caps&quot;&gt;TSB&lt;/span&gt; online statements to be confusing.  A snippet of the transactions in question are below.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.flickr.com/photos/chrisjroos/3240320685/&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3356/3240320685_12a1280ecc.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I paid a cheque in on Fri 16th Jan and tried to transfer most of it to another account on Weds 21st Jan (having convinced myself that I had enough in the account because of the deposit appearing on the statement).  Unfortunately, even though the deposit was listed on the statement the cheque hadn&amp;#8217;t actually cleared.  You can see the transfer was actually made on Thurs 22nd Jan so I was obviously one day premature.  I spoke to Lloyds this morning to see if I could get the ¬£20 back but apparently it was my own fault for not waiting five days and there was nothing they could do.  Maybe everyone else knows to ignore the items that appear in the transaction list but it really doesn&amp;#8217;t seem very intuitive to me.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Rant over.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

        <title>Backing Up Jobs in a Print Queue on Windows XP (and Printing .prn files)</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;I was asked to look at a Windows XP computer that had some jobs stuck in the print queue (the printer was reporting an error).  I added the same printer for a second time to check that it did still work; which it did.  Having done that I needed some way to transfer the jobs in the &amp;#8216;stuck&amp;#8217; queue to the new printer device.  This proved trickier than expected but I managed to get there in the end.  I changed the printer port of the &amp;#8216;stuck&amp;#8217; printer to file: (printer properties &amp;gt; ports) and printed each job in turn to a .prn file.  I deleted the dodgy printer device and then used this &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.lerup.com/printfile/&quot;&gt;Print File&lt;/a&gt; utility to print those .prn files using the good printer device.  The end.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

        <title>Idea - Firefox Extension to Clearly Indicate the Age of a Page</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;I think it&amp;#8217;s probably fairly common to see out of date content at the top of the search results when searching for phrases associated with fast moving technologies.  I imagine there are lots of posts to do with &lt;a href=&quot;http://rubyonrails.org/&quot;&gt;Rails&lt;/a&gt;, and everything associated therein, that don&amp;#8217;t apply anymore (unless you&amp;#8217;re developing against an old version of Rails maybe) but still appear high up the rankings.  I&amp;#8217;ve been thinking that it&amp;#8217;d be good to have some visual cue as to the age of the content: as a &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.mozilla.com/firefox&quot;&gt;firefox&lt;/a&gt; user an extension would be ideal (or maybe even a &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greasemonkey&quot;&gt;greasemonkey&lt;/a&gt; script).  At the very least it should display the date of the post in a standard place/format but it might be more useful to display the age as some quickly scannable text (2 years old, for example).  I&amp;#8217;m not sure how practical this would be: some pages will contain multiple dates, some won&amp;#8217;t contain any, some will contain the date in the &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/URL&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;caps&quot;&gt;URL&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, some will have it marked up as a &lt;a href=&quot;http://microformats.org/&quot;&gt;microformat&lt;/a&gt; and other things I can&amp;#8217;t think of right now.  This has been on a list of ideas for a while and as I&amp;#8217;ll probably never do anything with it I thought I&amp;#8217;d record it here.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

        <title>24 Hours of Ramsgate Outer Harbour</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;One Friday in September 2008 I had the bright idea (I don&amp;#8217;t remember where the inspiration came from) of slurping down images from the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.portoframsgate.co.uk/portoframsgate/welcome_to_the_marina/web_cam.aspx&quot;&gt;webcam that points at Ramsgate&amp;#8217;s outer harbour&lt;/a&gt;.  I used a combination of &lt;a href=&quot;http://curl.haxx.se/&quot;&gt;curl&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cron&quot;&gt;cron&lt;/a&gt; to download one image a minute for 24 hours starting around 14:30 on the Friday (2,678 images in total).  My intention was always to combine these into a little &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Time-lapse&quot;&gt;time-lapse&lt;/a&gt; movie and I finally got around to it last week (just the three months late then).  I played around with various ways to produce the movie (including &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.apple.com/ilife/imovie/&quot;&gt;iMovie&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;http://ffmpeg.mplayerhq.hu/&quot;&gt;ffmpeg&lt;/a&gt; and others that I no longer remember) but couldn&amp;#8217;t get the output I was after.  A little more searching revealed that &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.apple.com/quicktime/pro/&quot;&gt;Quicktime Pro&lt;/a&gt; could do exactly what I was after (I&amp;#8217;m afraid I can&amp;#8217;t find the original post I read about it) so I stumped up the ¬£20 and made my video.  I opted for 60 frames per second which results in a video of around 45 seconds which seems OK to me.  I chose to host it at &lt;a href=&quot;http://vimeo.com&quot;&gt;vimeo&lt;/a&gt; because I prefer the simplicity of their interface over &lt;a href=&quot;http://youtube.com&quot;&gt;youtube&lt;/a&gt; (as I&amp;#8217;m writing this I realised I probably could&amp;#8217;ve hosted it at &lt;a href=&quot;http://flickr.com&quot;&gt;flickr&lt;/a&gt; too).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#8217;m embedding it below (or you can see it at &lt;a href=&quot;http://vimeo.com/2743072&quot;&gt;vimeo&lt;/a&gt;) &lt;del&gt;but you&amp;#8217;ll have to excuse the large amount of whitespace between this paragraph and the video.  I&amp;#8217;ve had a real quick look but I&amp;#8217;m tired and really can&amp;#8217;t work out what&amp;#8217;s causing it.&lt;/del&gt;  &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.ademweb.co.uk/blog&quot;&gt;Adem&lt;/a&gt; spotted what I&amp;#8217;d done wrong and the whitespace has now been removed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;object width=&quot;400&quot; height=&quot;300&quot;&gt;
  &lt;param name=&quot;allowfullscreen&quot; value=&quot;true&quot; /&gt;
  &lt;param name=&quot;allowscriptaccess&quot; value=&quot;always&quot; /&gt;
  &lt;param name=&quot;movie&quot; value=&quot;http://vimeo.com/moogaloop.swf?clip_id=2743072&amp;amp;server=vimeo.com&amp;amp;show_title=1&amp;amp;show_byline=1&amp;amp;show_portrait=0&amp;amp;color=&amp;amp;fullscreen=1&quot; /&gt;
  &lt;embed src=&quot;http://vimeo.com/moogaloop.swf?clip_id=2743072&amp;amp;server=vimeo.com&amp;amp;show_title=0&amp;amp;show_byline=0&amp;amp;show_portrait=0&amp;amp;color=&amp;amp;fullscreen=1&quot; type=&quot;application/x-shockwave-flash&quot; allowfullscreen=&quot;true&quot; allowscriptaccess=&quot;always&quot; width=&quot;400&quot; height=&quot;300&quot;&gt;&lt;/embed&gt;
&lt;/object&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I love being able to see the massive volume of water that moves in and out of the harbour entrance raising and lowering the boats as it pleases.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

        <title>A Simple Utility to Generate and Preview Html on the Web</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;This happened a few months ago so I might be missing some of the specific details.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While at &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.reevoo.com&quot;&gt;reevoo&lt;/a&gt; we noticed that some of the images on our pages were being collapsed when the image source couldn&amp;#8217;t be found.  Trying to force the image to retain its size by specifying the dimensions in &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cascading_Style_Sheets&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;caps&quot;&gt;CSS&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt; or by setting the relevant attributes on the image tag had no effect.  I knew that I&amp;#8217;d seen &amp;#8216;blank&amp;#8217; (or broken) images in the past with specific sizes so couldn&amp;#8217;t understand what was going on.  Through a little trial and error I worked out that the collapsing of the images only occurred when a &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Document_Type_Declaration&quot;&gt;doctype&lt;/a&gt; was set.  I probably should&amp;#8217;ve left it there but instead proceeded to spend a couple of hours creating a little &lt;a href=&quot;/utilities/html-generator&quot;&gt;web based html editor&lt;/a&gt; (&lt;span class=&quot;caps&quot;&gt;NOTE&lt;/span&gt;. this is only tested in &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.mozilla.com/en-US/firefox/&quot;&gt;Firefox&lt;/a&gt;) that allowed me to see the effects different doctypes had on the html.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You can replicate my image experiment by entering something like &lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;img src=&quot;&quot; width=&quot;100px&quot; height=&quot;100px&quot; border=&quot;1px&quot;&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt; in the html body textarea.  When the doctype is left out (set to &amp;#8216;none&amp;#8217;) you&amp;#8217;ll see that the image element is 100 &amp;#215; 100px (or whatever you&amp;#8217;ve defined as the width and height).  Changing the doctype to anything else will result in the image element being &amp;#8216;collapsed&amp;#8217;.  I&amp;#8217;m afraid I never did get as far as working out why this was the case and I&amp;#8217;ve not had any use for the html generator since (good, huh).  If anyone knows why the broken images are collapsed when a doctype is set I&amp;#8217;d be interested to hear from you.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

        <title>Using SSI to Expose Http Request Headers Sent by Your Browser</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;Playing around with my &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.t-mobile.co.uk/g1-with-google-phone/&quot;&gt;T-Mobile G1&lt;/a&gt; made me wonder what the included web browser was.  I knew that I needed a site that would display the &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_HTTP_headers#Requests&quot;&gt;http request headers&lt;/a&gt; and through the magic of google happened upon &lt;a href=&quot;http://andylangton.co.uk&quot;&gt;Andy Langton&amp;#8217;s&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;http://andylangton.co.uk/online-tools/check-browser-headers&quot;&gt;check browser headers&lt;/a&gt; utility.  This did the job and let me know that the browser is some kind of mobile safari client built on &lt;a href=&quot;http://webkit.org/&quot;&gt;webkit&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That was all well and good but I started to wonder whether I could create an equivalent page without having to resort to a scripting language.  It turns out that I could use &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Server_Side_Includes&quot;&gt;Server Side Includes&lt;/a&gt; to do just that.  I had a couple of reasons to reinvent this particular wheel: a) to satisfy myself that I could do such a thing in a very short time, and b) to make the output as clear as possible.  The clarity thing is a big deal for me, I often find myself asking google for my &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IP_address&quot;&gt;IP&lt;/a&gt; only to follow a link to a page that contains my IP buried in a lot of noise (adverts, unnecessary text and lots of links).  I appreciate that Andy&amp;#8217;s utility doesn&amp;#8217;t contain any advertising but it still has some noise in the form of the blog template.  So, without further ado, I present my own little utility to &lt;a href=&quot;/utilities/http-request-headers/&quot;&gt;display http request headers&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

        <title>Initial Thoughts About the T-Mobile G1 (the Google Android Phone)</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#8217;ve been debating whether or not to get the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.t-mobile.co.uk/g1-with-google-phone/&quot;&gt;T-Mobile G1&lt;/a&gt; for a couple of months.  I finally made a decision and signed up to an 18 month contract a couple of days ago.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#8217;m still waiting for my number to be ported so I haven&amp;#8217;t used the phone in anger just yet.  I&amp;#8217;ve only really got as far as connecting it to my wireless network, installing some applications and using it to read email and browse the web.  Still, I figured that some of the things I&amp;#8217;ve found might be useful for others considering the phone.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The short version is, in my opinion, that if you use &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.apple.com/itunes/&quot;&gt;iTunes&lt;/a&gt; and you&amp;#8217;ve experienced the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.apple.com/uk/iphone/&quot;&gt;iPhone&lt;/a&gt; then this handset won&amp;#8217;t live up to your expectations.  To expand a little, I&amp;#8217;ll list in no particular order some of the problems I&amp;#8217;ve run into during my very limited test followed by some of the cooler features of the phone.  Before I do that though, a little aside, if I may.  Playing with the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.android.com/&quot;&gt;Android&lt;/a&gt; handset reminds me of when I installed &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.rockbox.org/&quot;&gt;rockbox&lt;/a&gt; on my iPod Nano.  There was clearly a lot of power/flexibility in there but in the end the simplicity and comfort of the iPod firmware won out.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Annoyances&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;I can&amp;#8217;t play songs from my iTunes library (more specifically, the songs that have been downloaded from iTunes).  This will result in me carrying two devices: this phone and an iPod (I guess this annoyance only applies when you consider that the iPhone will replace two devices with one, most other mobiles would suffer the same problem).&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;There&amp;#8217;s no video playback functionality out of the box.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;The battery life is very, very poor.  I&amp;#8217;ve installed the &lt;a href=&quot;http://code.google.com/p/watts/&quot;&gt;Watts&lt;/a&gt; application to track battery life over time.  It appears to indicate that my handset goes from 100% charge to 0% in just over a day (like, around 26 hours).  As I mention, this is only with very light use with &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wi-Fi&quot;&gt;WiFi&lt;/a&gt; enabled but no phone calls or text messages.  I wonder if I&amp;#8217;d think slightly differently if I was to treat the handset as a computer rather than a mobile (26 hours battery life for a computer, even the new &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Netbook&quot;&gt;netbooks&lt;/a&gt; is unheard of, or at least I think it is).&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;The handset relies on you having one &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.google.com/accounts&quot;&gt;google account&lt;/a&gt;.  Although I&amp;#8217;m trying to consolidate mine, I currently still have services split across two google accounts.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;I&amp;#8217;m finding it hard to know which apps to install.  The comments are often useless and there doesn&amp;#8217;t seem to be quite enough information to allow me to make a decision.  A related annoyance is that the market app is only available from the phone: I wonder if it&amp;#8217;d be easier to browse if it was available from a computer.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;The supplied instant messenger client is &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.google.com/talk/&quot;&gt;Google Talk&lt;/a&gt; only.  That happens to be one of the services that I haven&amp;#8217;t moved from one google account to the other so I&amp;#8217;m currently unable to use that functionality.  I also have contacts on other instant messenger networks that I&amp;#8217;d like to be able to chat to when mobile.  Maybe there&amp;#8217;s an &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.adiumx.com/&quot;&gt;adium&lt;/a&gt; like app that I can install, or even some kind of bridge between google talk and the other protocols that I can configure.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;There&amp;#8217;s no ability to read &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Portable_Document_Format&quot;&gt;PDFs&lt;/a&gt; out of the box.  I&amp;#8217;ve installed the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.westtek.com/android/&quot;&gt;Jetcet &lt;span class=&quot;caps&quot;&gt;PDF&lt;/span&gt; app&lt;/a&gt; which, although it does the job, isn&amp;#8217;t great.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;I&amp;#8217;ve found it difficult to find further information about apps I&amp;#8217;ve installed.  Specifically, the movie player.  The author is listed as Jeff Hamilton and with the help of Google I think I&amp;#8217;ve found that he&amp;#8217;s an Android developer.  The fact that he&amp;#8217;s an android developer is probably important (I&amp;#8217;m likely to trust his creations more than I might a third party developer) and I&amp;#8217;d just like to be able to find that stuff out more easily.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;There doesn&amp;#8217;t appear to be a way of storing my bookmarks in the cloud, or (more importantly) a &lt;a href=&quot;http://delicious.com/&quot;&gt;delicious&lt;/a&gt; plugin for the mobile Safari browser supplied.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;There&amp;#8217;s no &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jack_(connector)&quot;&gt;headphone jack&lt;/a&gt;.  The headphones supplied have a &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Universal_Serial_Bus#Mini.2C_Micro&quot;&gt;mini &lt;span class=&quot;caps&quot;&gt;USB&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt; connection.  I guess that&amp;#8217;s OK but as I mentioned above I&amp;#8217;m going to have to keep my iPod with me which will currently mean two sets of headphones.  I think I can probably buy a mini &lt;span class=&quot;caps&quot;&gt;USB&lt;/span&gt; adapter so that I can cut out one pair of headphones.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Trying to use the &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Accelerometer&quot;&gt;accelerometer&lt;/a&gt; to play &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pacman&quot;&gt;Pac Man&lt;/a&gt; just doesn&amp;#8217;t appear to work at all.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Annoyances that I&amp;#8217;ve solved while writing this post&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;I didn&amp;#8217;t think it was possible to stop a page loading in the browser, which is a pain if you accidentally follow a link that you didn&amp;#8217;t intend to.  I&amp;#8217;ve just found that this ability is available behind a click of the menu button.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;I didn&amp;#8217;t think there was any way to hit &amp;#8216;ctrl-c&amp;#8217; in the terminal application.  This led me to close the app after issuing a &amp;#8216;ping a.b.c.d&amp;#8217; command.  I realise now that the ctrl key is implemented as a click on the scroll wheel.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Things to consider&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;The handset is only supplied with a 2GB &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MicroSD&quot;&gt;Micro SD&lt;/a&gt; card.  I may well not run into a problem with this but it seems a bit stingy when you consider the 8GB and 16GB iPhones.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Good points&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I wouldn&amp;#8217;t be surprised if most of these good points apply to the other large screen, internet enabled phones available at the moment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Copy and paste.  If this had been missing (as it is in the iPhone) it would&amp;#8217;ve been very difficult for me to log into most of the websites I use frequently, as I use &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.pwdhash.com/&quot;&gt;pwdhash&lt;/a&gt; to generate a unique password for each site.  Although it&amp;#8217;s not ideal, the copy/paste functionality allows me to generate my password on pwdhash.com, copy it and then paste it into the site I&amp;#8217;m trying to access.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Having contacts synced immediately.  I&amp;#8217;ve never had this on any phone I&amp;#8217;ve owned so I consider it to be a great feature.  This is especially useful because I recently spent some time organising my google contacts and syncing them (using &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.soocial.com/&quot;&gt;soocial&lt;/a&gt;) with my Mac Address book.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Having my calendar immediately available on my phone and on the web.  I would previously rely on &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Short_message_service&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;caps&quot;&gt;SMS&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt; notifications from my google calendar to tell me when I was supposed to do something.  That worked fine but this is just a whole lot better.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Mobile email and web access.  This sounds obvious, but I&amp;#8217;ve not had an Internet enabled mobile (or at least not one that I&amp;#8217;ve kept long enough) before so it&amp;#8217;s a real plus.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Notifications.  I don&amp;#8217;t know whether the iPhone has something similar but having chats/tweets/emails/calendar reminders/downloads etc pop up when they&amp;#8217;re ready is really useful.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;</description>

        <title>Please Sir Can I Have a Job</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;OK, so I was made redundant from &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.reevoo.com&quot;&gt;reevoo&lt;/a&gt; just over a week ago and my initial holiday mood is now wearing off.  I have a couple of things to follow up but I definitely don&amp;#8217;t have anything concrete so I&amp;#8217;m putting this out there on the off chance someone wants to employ me (permanent or contract).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is a direct copy of an email I sent someone when they requested a CV.  It&amp;#8217;s not very comprehensive but it hopefully gives some indication of what I&amp;#8217;m able to do.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Employment&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I spent just over three years at &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.reevoo.com&quot;&gt;reevoo.com&lt;/a&gt;, until being made redundant on Monday 8th Dec 2008.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Skills&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.ruby-lang.org/en/&quot;&gt;Ruby&lt;/a&gt;.  A splendid little language.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.rubyonrails.org/&quot;&gt;Rails&lt;/a&gt;.  Although I started using Rails in August 2005, I&amp;#8217;ve definitely missed out on some of the more recent changes.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JavaScript&quot;&gt;Javascript&lt;/a&gt;.  Should only be used to enhance existing functionality and should (probably) never be &lt;em&gt;required&lt;/em&gt; for a site.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software_testing&quot;&gt;Testing&lt;/a&gt;.  I&amp;#8217;m completely sold on testing at all levels (&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.ruby-doc.org/stdlib/libdoc/test/unit/rdoc/&quot;&gt;test/unit&lt;/a&gt; up to &lt;a href=&quot;http://seleniumhq.org/&quot;&gt;selenium&lt;/a&gt;, or an equivalent).&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cascading_Style_Sheets&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;caps&quot;&gt;CSS&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.  I&amp;#8217;m not brilliant with &lt;span class=&quot;caps&quot;&gt;CSS&lt;/span&gt; and although I can get reasonable results it&amp;#8217;ll take me longer than it would someone that really knows their stuff.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTML&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;caps&quot;&gt;HTML&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.  I love clean and semantically marked up &lt;span class=&quot;caps&quot;&gt;HTML&lt;/span&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pair_programming&quot;&gt;Pair Programming&lt;/a&gt;.  I prefer to pair program, particularly on production code.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Desired workplace&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;I want to work with smart people.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;I want to work on software that has a purpose I believe in.&lt;/li&gt;

	&lt;li&gt;Websites that are poorly marked up, therefore making scraping them hard :-) (particularly bank websites)&lt;/li&gt;

        <title>A Utility to Manage Apache Virtual Hosts on a Mac (Like the Passenger Pref Pane but for Simple Static Sites)</title>
        <description>&lt;div class=&quot;notice&quot;&gt;29 June 2009.  See the &lt;a href=&quot;/blog/2009-06-23-apacherb-is-now-hostess&quot;&gt;updated post&lt;/a&gt; about this utility.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I really like the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.fngtps.com/2008/06/putting-the-pane-back-into-deployment&quot;&gt;Passenger preference pane&lt;/a&gt;, for both its functionality and simplicity.  I wondered whether there was anything similar that would allow me to create simple &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virtual_hosting&quot;&gt;virtual hosts&lt;/a&gt; in the same way (i.e. create the &lt;a href=&quot;http://httpd.apache.org/&quot;&gt;apache&lt;/a&gt; config and register the hostname with &lt;a href=&quot;http://developer.apple.com/opensource/dirservices/&quot;&gt;directory services&lt;/a&gt;).  I saw mention of something called headdress (that supposedly makes apache config easier) but the site&amp;#8217;s been down for the last couple of days and I believe it&amp;#8217;s pay-for software anyway.  I decided to steal the concepts (and the code for the &lt;a href=&quot;http://developer.apple.com/documentation/Darwin/Reference/ManPages/man1/dscl.1.html&quot;&gt;dscl&lt;/a&gt; stuff) from the &lt;a href=&quot;http://github.com/alloy/passengerpane/tree/master&quot;&gt;passenger pref pane code&lt;/a&gt; and create a little shell script that allows me to manage virtual hosts on my Mac.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You can get it by checking out the &lt;a href=&quot;http://chrisroos.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/apacherb/&quot;&gt;source&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class=&quot;code&quot;&gt;
svn co http://chrisroos.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/apacherb
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It works in a very similar way to the Passenger preference pane: you give it a domain and directory (&lt;code&gt;sudo apacherb create chrisroos.local /path/to/chrisroos.local&lt;/code&gt;) and it&amp;#8217;ll create the necessary config (in /etc/apache2/apacherb_vhosts/) and register the domain with directory services.  You can also delete (&lt;code&gt;sudo apacherb delete chrisroos.local&lt;/code&gt;) and list (&lt;code&gt;apacherb list&lt;/code&gt;) these vhosts.  Just execute the script to see the help message (or look at the code).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I use this script to generate apache virtual hosts, instead of using the built in &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.webrick.org/&quot;&gt;webrick&lt;/a&gt; server, for my &lt;a href=&quot;http://webby.rubyforge.org/&quot;&gt;webby&lt;/a&gt; sites so that I can see them exactly as they&amp;#8217;ll appear when they&amp;#8217;re deployed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#8217;d be interested to know if this is of use to anyone else and if there&amp;#8217;s anything else you&amp;#8217;d like to see it do.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

        <title>A Javascript QueryString Printer</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#8217;ve used this &lt;a href=&quot;http://httpd.apache.org/docs/1.3/mod/mod_rewrite.html&quot;&gt;mod rewrite&lt;/a&gt; trick in the past to inspect the contents of various &lt;a href=&quot;http://httpd.apache.org/&quot;&gt;apache&lt;/a&gt; variables you have access to.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class=&quot;code&quot;&gt;
# Add this before any other rewrite rules in your apache config or .htaccess
RewriteRule .* http://foo?request_uri=%{REQUEST_URI}&amp;amp;the_request=%{THE_REQUEST}&amp;amp;host=%{HTTP_HOST}
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Although useful, it&amp;#8217;s kinda hard to inspect the variables when they&amp;#8217;re in the &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uniform_Resource_Locator&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;caps&quot;&gt;URL&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.  It dawned on me that it would be easier to see them if they were in a page in the browser itself.  So, I knocked up a simple little html page that uses javascript to extract the querystring key/value pairs and display them on the page.  It doesn&amp;#8217;t look very pretty but it makes it much easier to see the content of the variables.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;del&gt;The page is hosted in my &lt;a href=&quot;http://chrisroos.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/querystring-printer/&quot;&gt;google code repository&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/del&gt; and there&amp;#8217;s a splendid little screenshot below.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3288/3082048735_f76b44712e.jpg?v=0&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;del&gt;At the moment you&amp;#8217;ll need to host this file yourself, but if there&amp;#8217;s demand then I can probably make it publicly available somewhere.&lt;/del&gt;  You can either host this file yourself or point at the &lt;a href=&quot;/utilities/querystring-printer&quot;&gt;version in my utilities&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

        <title>OCR on the Mac with Tesseract</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;I wanted to &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Optical_character_recognition&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;caps&quot;&gt;OCR&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt; another letter this morning and, as &lt;a href=&quot;/articles/2008-07-21-open-source-optical-character-recognition-ocr-on-the-mac&quot;&gt;before&lt;/a&gt;, I used &lt;a href=&quot;http://code.google.com/p/tesseract-ocr/&quot;&gt;tesseract&lt;/a&gt; for the job.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I ended up spending some time testing the quality of the output (the generated text) against different quality inputs (as defined by the &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dots_per_inch&quot;&gt;dpi&lt;/a&gt; setting in my scanner software).  The results were not surprising. The best output, with only a couple of errors in the whole letter, came from the 300dpi scan (the highest I tried). The scan at 150dpi contained a handful of mistakes and at 96dpi the output was, in places, complete gibberish.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In case this is of use to anyone I have copies of the, smaller, second page of the letter I was scanning, along with the OCRd output.  The scanner is an &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.epson.co.uk/products/all_in_one_products/Stylus_DX4800.htm&quot;&gt;Epson Stylus DX4800&lt;/a&gt; and I used &lt;a href=&quot;http://seashore.sourceforge.net/&quot;&gt;seashore&lt;/a&gt; to convert the images, from colour jpegs, to greyscale tiffs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;At 300dpi&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://flickr.com/photos/chrisjroos/3076819819/&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3202/3076819819_d4f1a3f3cd_t.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;letter&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nothing is ruled out in terms of further development, and I have met with a representative of mySociety to discuss ways of continuing to improve what we do.&lt;br /&gt;

I hope that this is helpful to your constituent.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

        <title>Listening to iTunes on my Intempo GX-01</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#8217;ve had the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.intempodigital.com/GX-01/AJ100008,en_GB,pd.html&quot;&gt;Intempo GX-01&lt;/a&gt; for a while but have only just felt the need to play my &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.apple.com/itunes/&quot;&gt;iTunes&lt;/a&gt; library through it.  It turns out that I needed something that could share my iTunes library using the &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Universal_Plug_and_Play&quot;&gt;UPnP&lt;/a&gt; protocol.  I tried a few different applications before finally settling on the excellent &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.elgato.com/elgato/na/mainmenu/products/software/EyeConnect.en.html&quot;&gt;EyeConnect&lt;/a&gt; application.  Although it&amp;#8217;s commercial software it&amp;#8217;s offered with a free 30 day trial, and, it would appear that even after the 30 days the audio sharing functionality remains free forever.  Yay.  It installs as a preference pane which means you can install it, configure it, set it running and then forget about it: it does what it needs to and gets out of your way.  I&amp;#8217;ve only really dabbled with it at the moment but I&amp;#8217;m certainly impressed with what I&amp;#8217;ve seen so far.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;The alternatives (in the interest of fairness)&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.nullriver.com/products/medialink&quot;&gt;Nullriver MediaLink&lt;/a&gt; &amp;#8211; The first application I tried.  I was immediately hooked on the simplicity and would have been more than willing to pay for it.  Unfortunately, although my radio could see my iTunes library, it refused to play any music: The Intempo responded with &amp;#8220;UPnP Internal Error 113&amp;#8221;.  It took me a while to realise that this software was specifically designed for the PS3 and I can only assume that&amp;#8217;s the reason for the error I received.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.allegrosoft.com/ams.html&quot;&gt;Allegro Media Server&lt;/a&gt; &amp;#8211; This worked fine but it felt a bit kludgy.  I&amp;#8217;d guess this was because of the elegance of the Nullriver offering though.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.twonkyvision.de/Products/TwonkyMedia/index.html&quot;&gt;TwonkyMedia Media Server&lt;/a&gt; &amp;#8211; As with the Allegro offering this worked fine but felt a little kludgy and over-complicated.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://xbmc.org/&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;caps&quot;&gt;XBMC&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &amp;#8211; I&amp;#8217;m afraid I only got as far as downloading, opening the application and immediately closing it.  It was immediately clear that this was far too complicated for what I was after.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;</description>

        <title>Changing the repository of code being managed by Piston (an alternative to piston switch)</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#8217;ve been working on a little script that gives us visibility of the state of the &lt;a href=&quot;http://piston.rubyforge.org/&quot;&gt;pistonised&lt;/a&gt; components of &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.reevoo.com&quot;&gt;our&lt;/a&gt; applications.  One of the things I noticed was that we&amp;#8217;d used multiple domains to pistonise content from our own &lt;a href=&quot;http://subversion.tigris.org/&quot;&gt;repository&lt;/a&gt;.  I wanted to standardise them all and thought I&amp;#8217;d be able to use the &lt;a href=&quot;http://blade.nagaokaut.ac.jp/cgi-bin/scat.rb/ruby/ruby-talk/235517&quot;&gt;piston switch&lt;/a&gt; command to do just that.  Unfortunately, the piston switch command appears to work only when switching between URLs where the domain remains constant (switching between example.com/tag/1 and example.com/tag/2, for example).  I needed to change the domain part of the &lt;span class=&quot;caps&quot;&gt;URL&lt;/span&gt; (svn.example.com to www.example.com) and in some cases the port (example.com:8080 to example.com).  I figured I could just change the &amp;#8220;piston:root&amp;#8221; &lt;a href=&quot;http://svnbook.red-bean.com/en/1.1/ch07s02.html&quot;&gt;subversion property&lt;/a&gt; and used svn propedit to do just that.  Unfortunately, on committing the change I could no longer piston update, I was getting a &amp;#8216;command not found&amp;#8217; error from the shell.  This was a bit odd so I dug into the code.  It turns out that there was an extra newline in the piston:root property that was screwing up the svn checkout (the bit after the newline was being treated as a new command by the shell, hence the error).  The solution was to use svn propset rather than svn propedit to set the piston:root property: for some reason svn propedit introduces this unwanted newline, where svn propset doesn&amp;#8217;t.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

        <title>Converting Google Code Wiki Content to Html</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#8217;ve created a little script that allows me to convert documents in the &lt;a href=&quot;http://code.google.com&quot;&gt;google code&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;http://code.google.com/p/support/wiki/WikiSyntax&quot;&gt;wiki format&lt;/a&gt; to &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTML&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;caps&quot;&gt;HTML&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The script lives in &lt;a href=&quot;http://chrisroos.googlecode.com&quot;&gt;my google code repository&lt;/a&gt;.  Check it out from subversion:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class=&quot;code shell&quot;&gt;
svn co http://chrisroos.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/google-wiki-syntax
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The wiki_convertor script takes two arguments.  The first is the wiki file, or directory containing multiple wiki files, and the second is the output directory.  So, to use it to create an html copy of the &lt;a href=&quot;http://code.google.com/doctype/&quot;&gt;google-doctype&lt;/a&gt; wiki content, in my home Sites directory, I&amp;#8217;d use the following command:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class=&quot;code shell&quot;&gt;
wiki_convertor.rb ~/Code/third-party/google-doctype/wiki/ ~/Sites/google-doctype/
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is the first step towards being able to, hopefully, create a &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Portable_Document_Format&quot;&gt;pdf&lt;/a&gt; copy of the google-doctype content.  Actually, if anyone has any thoughts on this I&amp;#8217;d love to hear them: should I output a different format (&lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DocBook&quot;&gt;docbook&lt;/a&gt;, for example) or is it easy enough to convert from (x)html to pdf?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The code is covered by quite a few tests but, if peeps find problems converting their own wiki content (for example) then I&amp;#8217;d love to hear from you.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Note&lt;/strong&gt; There&amp;#8217;s a chance that this becomes less important &lt;a href=&quot;http://code.google.com/docreader/#p(google-documentation-reader)s(google-documentation-reader)t(OfflineSupport&quot;&gt;if/when&lt;/a&gt; Google use &lt;a href=&quot;http://gears.google.com/&quot;&gt;gears&lt;/a&gt; in their &lt;a href=&quot;http://code.google.com/docreader/#p(google-documentation-reader)s(google-documentation-reader)t(google-documentation-reader&quot;&gt;google docreader&lt;/a&gt; app to allow offline access.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Note&lt;/strong&gt; If you don&amp;#8217;t want to go through this process then you can use a standalone version of &lt;a href=&quot;http://moinmoin.wikiwikiweb.de/&quot;&gt;moinmoin&lt;/a&gt; to &lt;a href=&quot;http://groups.google.com/group/google-doctype/browse_thread/thread/5fe1d26a0afdc4c7&quot;&gt;view your wiki content offline&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

        <title>Plans for the my blog</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;There&amp;#8217;s a bunch of stuff that I want to do to this blog to simplify things even further. I&amp;#8217;m writing them up to force me to think about them and to see if anyone has any thoughts about my proposals. I&amp;#8217;m sure there&amp;#8217;s lots more I could do but this should keep me busy for quite a while.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Remove the archive pages.  These are the pages that exist so that you can see every post in a given year, month or day.  I don&amp;#8217;t think I&amp;#8217;ve ever wanted to read these archives on anyone elses site and I can&amp;#8217;t think that anyone would want to do so here.  They are not linked from anywhere on this site (I removed the links when I switched to a &lt;a href=&quot;/blog/2008-01-23-migration-from-typo-to-a-static-site-is-complete&quot;&gt;static site&lt;/a&gt;) but I know they are still in the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.google.co.uk&quot;&gt;google&lt;/a&gt; index.  I find it annoying if I click on a link to such an archive page as I then have to do a second search, within the page, to find what I&amp;#8217;m looking for.  I guess this might be one of the reasons why google&amp;#8217;s guidelines state that you should &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.google.com/support/webmasters/bin/answer.py?answer=35769&quot;&gt;use robots.txt to prevent crawling of SERPs&lt;/a&gt; (more info from &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.mattcutts.com/blog/search-results-in-search-results/&quot;&gt;Matt Cutts&lt;/a&gt;).  It&amp;#8217;s for this reason that I removed all paging on the site and redirect anyone that follows a link to a paged page (e.g. articles/page/5) to my &lt;a href=&quot;/contents&quot;&gt;contents&lt;/a&gt; page, explaining why they might not be expecting to see that page.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Change the &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uniform_Resource_Locator&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;caps&quot;&gt;URL&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt; structure to reflect the removal of the archive pages.  My URLs currently look something like /articles/2007/01/01/article-title.  I want to change them to /articles/2007-01-01-title.  This will still allow people, if they really, really wanted, to replicate the functionality of my archive pages by using the google site search functionality (site:blog.seagul.co.uk/articles/2007-05 for all articles in May 2007, for example).  Retaining the date in the &lt;span class=&quot;caps&quot;&gt;URL&lt;/span&gt; has two (that I can think of) benefits: I find it really useful to get an idea of the age (and possibly relevancy) of a post, and it provides a neat way to generate permalinks.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Remove the tag pages.  For the same reason that I&amp;#8217;ve removed the paged pages and want to remove the archive pages.  I haven&amp;#8217;t been tagging any articles since the switch to a static site and only maintain these pages for the legacy tags.  If I really suffer from the lack of tags then I guess I&amp;#8217;ll just use a tagging service (such as &lt;a href=&quot;http://del.icio.us&quot;&gt;del.icio.us&lt;/a&gt;) to bookmark my posts with relevant tags.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Remove articles from the url, so that /articles/2007-01-01-blurgh becomes /2007-01-01-blurgh.  It doesn&amp;#8217;t add anything and I&amp;#8217;m not worried about namespace clashes (one thing it could potentially solve).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Move all the content from blog.seagul.co.uk to chrisroos.co.uk/blog.  I want to start using this domain as a starting point for my online identity.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Create chrisroos.co.uk/projects in an attempt to record details of the things that I might class as projects.  This might also solve some of the shortfalls of not having tags (if I did have tags then I might be able to implement this projects idea by using them).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Add the ability to search the site from the site itself (using &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.google.com/sitesearch/&quot;&gt;google site search&lt;/a&gt; or similar). I sometimes find the need to search my own site and having to do site:blog.seagul.co.uk keywords can become frustrating.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Revisit previous articles and add meta descriptions to their pages.  This is the text that google displays in their &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Search_engine_results_page&quot;&gt;SERPs&lt;/a&gt; and is generally useful as an overview of the content.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Add the permalink of each post in the form of a &lt;a href=&quot;http://microformats.org/wiki/rel-bookmark&quot;&gt;link rel=bookmark&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Add link tags (prev, next, home?) to describe the &lt;a href=&quot;http://diveintoaccessibility.org/day_9_providing_additional_navigation_aids.html&quot;&gt;relationship between posts&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Remove the embedded syntax highlighting from some of the posts, preferring, instead, a &lt;a href=&quot;http://code.google.com/p/syntaxhighlighter/&quot;&gt;javascript solution&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Attempt to clear up any broken links in the content.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Note&lt;/strong&gt; A guiding principle behind the removal of composite pages (tags, archives and paged pages) is that a post should only appear at one &lt;span class=&quot;caps&quot;&gt;URL&lt;/span&gt; on this site.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Note&lt;/strong&gt; I believe there may be benefits of the archive and tag pages in that they allow search engines to effectively spider all your content. I&amp;#8217;m fairly happy that my contents page and sitemap mean that I&amp;#8217;m covered in this respect.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Steps required to move towards the architecture (&lt;span class=&quot;caps&quot;&gt;URL&lt;/span&gt;) changes&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Add &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Noindex&quot;&gt;noindex&lt;/a&gt; to all the archive pages, and optionally request their removal, so that they disappear from the search engine indexes.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Add noindex to all the tag pages, and optionally request their removal, so that they disappear from the search engine indexes.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Possibly redirect requests for archive pages to a google search that provides the same functionality.  Alternatively redirect them to my contents page.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Redirect requests for tag pages to my contents page.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Redirect all requests for URLs that start with /articles to the &lt;span class=&quot;caps&quot;&gt;URL&lt;/span&gt; without /articles.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Redirect all requests for URLs on the blog.seagul.co.uk domain to chrisroos.co.uk/blog.&lt;/li&gt;

        <title>Asking South Eastern about the high speed trains</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;I noticed, having already written everything below, that there&amp;#8217;s actually quite a lot of information about the high speed proposals on the &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Southeastern_(train_operating_company)#Future_expansion&quot;&gt;South Eastern&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;http://wikipedia.org/&quot;&gt;wikipedia&lt;/a&gt; page.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There&amp;#8217;s been lots of speculation about the new high speed trains that are going to decrease journey times from, parts of, &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kent&quot;&gt;Kent&lt;/a&gt; to &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/London&quot;&gt;London&lt;/a&gt;.  The south eastern site is very sparse on the details of these new services so I thought I&amp;#8217;d email them to ask for more details: I&amp;#8217;m specifically interested in journey times from &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ramsgate&quot;&gt;Ramsgate&lt;/a&gt; to London.  I shouldn&amp;#8217;t be surprised, but their answer contains essentially no information.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I mentioned to a signal man friend at the weekend and he was of the impression that they&amp;#8217;d be running fast services direct from Ramsgate to &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/St_Pancras_railway_station&quot;&gt;St Pancras&lt;/a&gt; and from &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Canterbury&quot;&gt;Canterbury&lt;/a&gt; to St Pancras.  I&amp;#8217;ll guess we&amp;#8217;ll just have to wait a year or so to find out what they&amp;#8217;re actually going to do.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My email (submitted through their &lt;a href=&quot;http://southeasternrailway.co.uk/contact.php&quot;&gt;contact form&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;emailBody&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hi,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I wonder if you‚Äôd be able to let me know your plans for services between Ramsgate and London when the new high speed trains are introduced?  Although there‚Äôs been a great deal of speculation about a high speed service between Ramsgate and St Pancras, I‚Äôve never seen anything concrete.  Indeed, from what I‚Äôve read so far, I‚Äôm guessing that there won‚Äôt be a direct high speed link between Ramsgate and London (I‚Äôd love to hear otherwise though).  Rather, I suspect that it‚Äôll be possible to get a traditional train from Ramsgate to Ashford and then to join a high speed train to St Pancras (so the journey time will be about 77 minutes on the train with a change at Ashford).  Is this the plan?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I also wonder if you might shed some light on the proposed price increases to use the new high speed service?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Cheers, and I look forward to a reply,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Chris&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And their response (&lt;a href=&quot;http://flickr.com/photos/chrisjroos/2688362103/&quot;&gt;original&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=&quot;http://flickr.com/photos/chrisjroos/2688361813/&quot;&gt;page 2&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Dear Mr Roos,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;HS1 services&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thank you for your website comment that we received on 10 July 2008, regarding the high speed services that will commence in 2009.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We will be introducing services on HS1 (the new name for the Channel Tunnel Rail Link) from December 2009 and the timetable for our existing ‚Äòclassic‚Äô routes will be re-drawn completely.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Services using HS1 will go to London&amp;#8217;s St Pancras station and journey times from places like Ashford, Folkestone, Canterbury, Ramsgate and Dover will be significantly reduced. We understand that many people are keen to know exactly what the timetable and fares will be, but I hope you will understand that this is still at the planning stage and the details are yet to be finalised.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Department for Transport (DfT) has set out the overarching specification for the timetable that we will deliver. We are currently reviewing this specification and have started to test the journey times with the first of the new trains. Once we are able to share the detail of the timetable we will communicate it to customers via our website and the media. As with any other timetable change, we will be consulting with Passenger Focus and London TravelWatch, the two main passenger watchdogs before the timetable is introduced. So if a strong economic argument for a particular service can be demonstrated, and the railway industry can accommodate it, we would present a business case to the DtT to support its introduction.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;ln the meantime, our website does have some details about the proposed journey times and routes. This can be located on our homepage by clicking on &amp;#8220;High Speed Services&amp;#8221; on the left hand side and then &amp;#8220;Frequency of trains&amp;#8221;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thank you for taking the time to contact us.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yours sincerely&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Russell L. D&amp;#8217;Eath&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Asking South Eastern about their crappy seats</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;I regularly travel on the &lt;a href=&quot;http://southeasternrailway.co.uk/&quot;&gt;South Eastern&lt;/a&gt; service from &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Waterloo_East_railway_station&quot;&gt;Waterloo East&lt;/a&gt; to &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ramsgate&quot;&gt;Ramsgate&lt;/a&gt;.  The train splits at &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ashford_International&quot;&gt;Ashford&lt;/a&gt; and I end up having to sit in the shitty commuter seats for the last 45 minutes (or so) of the journey.  I emailed South Eastern to ask if they couldn&amp;#8217;t reconfigure the train so that, of the eight cars that go to Dover, four could have commuter seats and four could have real seats.  They could then send the other four cars, with real seats, to Ramsgate.  I don&amp;#8217;t think I have the original email that I sent (feedback forms in general suffer from the problem that the sender doesn&amp;#8217;t retain a copy of what&amp;#8217;s been sent) but their reply is below (&lt;a href=&quot;http://flickr.com/photos/chrisjroos/2688362397/&quot;&gt;original here&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;letter&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ref: 329980 / 93994&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dear Mr Roos&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Formation of 17.59 Waterloo East to Ramsgate Service&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thank you for your email of 2nd May&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I am sorry that you have found the seating on the rear four carriages of the above service to be uncomfortable. These are the higher density carriages that have 2+3 seating across the coach, rather than 2+2 seating, and are intended to deal with the heavy demand we face during the busy peak periods. We know that everyone would prefer all our trains to have 2+2 seating throughout. However, we have to utilise the higher density seating layout in order to provide enough seats for our London commuters.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For a number of operational factors (for example, rolling stock maintenance), it is difficult to locate a set of four higher density carriages in the middle of a twelve-coach train, where the front and rear portions are formed of 2+2 seating. The usual procedure is to have four or eight carriages which are the same, and to have an additonai four carriages of either the higher density or 2+2 rolling stock. In addition to this, we have to look at the wider picture and consider what is needed for later services or on the following morning (as a rule, it is not possible to &amp;#8220;mix-and-match&amp;#8221; rolling stock to it each journey).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For these reasons, it is unlikely that we will be able to make the change that to have requested. Thank you, however, for sharing your concerns with us. Passenger feedback, whether good or bad, is always appreciated so that we can continue to improve on the service we offer, and I hope you can be reassured that we take all issues very seriously.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yours sincerely&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;David Eustace&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Southeastern Customer Services&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Open Source Optical Character Recognition (OCR) on the Mac</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;I recently received a letter reply to an enquiry I made to &lt;a href=&quot;http://southeasternrailway.co.uk/&quot;&gt;South Eastern Trains&lt;/a&gt;.  I wanted to make the text available (I don&amp;#8217;t like reading text in images) but didn&amp;#8217;t want to type it all out.  Having scanned it in, I looked around for some &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Optical_character_recognition&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;caps&quot;&gt;OCR&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt; software, for the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.apple.com/mac/&quot;&gt;Mac&lt;/a&gt;, that would extract the text for me.  Through the (relatively large amount of) search result noise, I managed to find a reference to &lt;a href=&quot;http://code.google.com/p/tesseract-ocr/&quot;&gt;tesseract&lt;/a&gt;.  Installing from &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.macports.org/&quot;&gt;Mac Ports&lt;/a&gt; was easy but actually getting useful output was slightly tricker.  I was trying to extract the text from &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.flickr.com/photos/chrisjroos/2688362397/&quot;&gt;this letter&lt;/a&gt; but kept getting garbled output.  I tried a few things before stumbling across &lt;a href=&quot;https://help.ubuntu.com/community/OCR&quot;&gt;this page&lt;/a&gt; that suggests making the image greyscale and ensuring that the extension is .tif (not .tiff).  I duly complied, using &lt;a href=&quot;http://seashore.sourceforge.net/&quot;&gt;Seashore&lt;/a&gt; to convert the image to greyscale, and tried again.  This time the text was extracted perfectly (even the addresses, that appear in two columns, were extracted correctly).&lt;/p&gt;</description>

        <title>Pwdhash Widget</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#8217;ve been using &lt;a href=&quot;http://pwdhash.com&quot;&gt;pwdhash&lt;/a&gt; for ages.  Apart from some pathetic sites that impose password limitations (less than x characters, or no &amp;#8216;strange&amp;#8217; characters), I&amp;#8217;ve used it on every site I&amp;#8217;ve signed up to.  This has started to change recently as more sites offer a client application that sits alongside the online app (&lt;a href=&quot;http://flickr.com&quot;&gt;flickr&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;http://twitter.com&quot;&gt;twitter&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;http://last.fm&quot;&gt;last.fm&lt;/a&gt; come to mind): It&amp;#8217;s a pain to visit pwdhash.com every time I need to generate a password for an offline app.  So, I decided to have a stab at creating a dashboard widget to generate password hashes.  I used &lt;a href=&quot;http://developer.apple.com/tools/dashcode/&quot;&gt;dashcode&lt;/a&gt; (which makes this stuff &lt;em&gt;really&lt;/em&gt; easy) and got something knocked up, in about an hour, on &lt;a href=&quot;http://twitter.com/chrisroos/statuses/812954936&quot;&gt;Friday&lt;/a&gt;.  The fact that pwdhash.com is already composed of html and javascript helped just a bit too&amp;#8230;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Anyway, if it sounds useful feel then free to download it &lt;a href=&quot;/files/pwdhash.zip&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

        <title>A trip to the tip</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;A recent trip to the local tip got me thinking.  Shouldn&amp;#8217;t the council be pimping alternative services (freecycle and charity shops come to mind) at the tip?  I saw a couple of things that I struggle to believe couldn&amp;#8217;t have been of use to someone else: a golf bag and computer tower (even if it didn&amp;#8217;t contain a computer &amp;#8211; I just sold a similar case on ebay, proving the demand).  In addition to these two items were the mountain (ok, not a mountain, but a fair number) of discarded fridge/freezers.  I wonder how many of these had actually broken and how many were no longer required for different reasons: maybe England beer fridges are out of fashion now?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, at the very least, I think the council should just pop some signs up suggesting alternative fates for your unwanted stuff.  But, taking it further, I wonder whether the council couldn&amp;#8217;t operate a similar sized (to the current tip) site that served as a drop-off/pick-up point for freecycle?  I&amp;#8217;d hope that, after a while, the cost of this second site would be offset by the savings made at the tip by the reduction in use (although that may be wishful thinking).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Maybe a hybrid alternative would be to train the current tip workers to filter out items of possible reuse from the actual rubbish, thereby allowing the existing site to be use for both purposes.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

        <title>Redesigning my blog</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;I finally got round to updating my blog template this weekend.  I based the new design on the &lt;a href=&quot;http://developer.yahoo.com/yui/grids/&quot;&gt;yui grids css&lt;/a&gt; in an attempt to provide the same look to users of different browsers.  In addition I&amp;#8217;ve &amp;#8216;borrowed&amp;#8217; some ideas from both the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.w3.org/TR/xhtml1/&quot;&gt;w3c specification pages&lt;/a&gt; (the blue colour) and the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.pearsonified.com/theme/copyblogger/&quot;&gt;copyblogger wordpress theme&lt;/a&gt; (mainly the header, seen on &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.techbelly.com&quot;&gt;Ben&amp;#8217;s&lt;/a&gt; blog).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#8217;ve also created a really simple print stylesheet (it just removes the right nav) that should make it possible to print the content out if you so wish.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There&amp;#8217;s still work to do: the code snippets seem to break IE6 (not sure about IE7) but in general I&amp;#8217;m pretty happy with the way it&amp;#8217;s looking.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

        <title>Exporting query results to a remote machine with MySql (an alternative to SELECT INTO OUTFILE)</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;Exporting query results to a remote machine with MySql (an alternative to &lt;span class=&quot;caps&quot;&gt;SELECT&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;caps&quot;&gt;INTO&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;caps&quot;&gt;OUTFILE&lt;/span&gt;)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://mysql.com&quot;&gt;MySql&amp;#8217;s&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;http://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.0/en/select.html&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;caps&quot;&gt;SELECT&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;caps&quot;&gt;INTO&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;caps&quot;&gt;OUTFILE&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt; syntax provides a nice way to export the results of a query into a tab delimited (by default) text file.  Unfortunately, the file has to be created on the MySql host (by a user with file permissions), rendering it unsuitable for dumping the data to a remote machine.  If you wish to dump the query results to a different machine then the &lt;a href=&quot;http://dev.mysql.com/doc/&quot;&gt;mysql docs&lt;/a&gt; suggest redirecting the output from the mysql command line client:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The &lt;span class=&quot;caps&quot;&gt;SELECT&lt;/span&gt; &amp;#8230; &lt;span class=&quot;caps&quot;&gt;INTO&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;caps&quot;&gt;OUTFILE&lt;/span&gt; statement is intended primarily to let you very quickly dump a table to a text file on the server machine. If you want to create the resulting file on some client host other than the server host, you cannot use &lt;span class=&quot;caps&quot;&gt;SELECT&lt;/span&gt; &amp;#8230; &lt;span class=&quot;caps&quot;&gt;INTO&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;caps&quot;&gt;OUTFILE&lt;/span&gt;. In that case, you should instead use a command such as mysql -e &amp;#8220;&lt;span class=&quot;caps&quot;&gt;SELECT&lt;/span&gt; &amp;#8230;&amp;#8221; &amp;gt;  file_name to generate the file on the client host.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This works great but the default output you&amp;#8217;ll get from redirecting &lt;span class=&quot;caps&quot;&gt;STDOUT&lt;/span&gt; won&amp;#8217;t be the same as using &lt;span class=&quot;caps&quot;&gt;SELECT&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;caps&quot;&gt;INTO&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;caps&quot;&gt;OUTFILE&lt;/span&gt;.  The two main (only?) differences are, in the redirected output, the addition of the headers and that &lt;span class=&quot;caps&quot;&gt;NULL&lt;/span&gt; values are output as &lt;span class=&quot;caps&quot;&gt;NULL&lt;/span&gt; instead of the special \N (backslash-N) sequence.  We can fix both of these things by specifying an optional switch (skip-column-names) to the mysql client and employing some &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sed&quot;&gt;sed&lt;/a&gt; magic.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class=&quot;code shell&quot;&gt;
mysql -h&quot;my-host&quot; -u&quot;my-user&quot; -p&quot;my-password&quot; -e&quot;select * from my-database.my-table&quot; --skip-column-names |\
  sed -e &#39;s/[[:&amp;lt;:]]NULL[[:&amp;gt;:]]/\\N/g&#39; &amp;gt;\
  my-export-directory/my-table.csv`
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That sed magic is replacing instances of &lt;span class=&quot;caps&quot;&gt;NULL&lt;/span&gt;, surrounded by some whitespace, with the special \N escape sequence.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Oh, and it&amp;#8217;s probably worth mentioning that this is only really important if you want to load this data back into mysql (using &lt;a href=&quot;http://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.0/en/load-data.html&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;caps&quot;&gt;LOAD&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;caps&quot;&gt;DATA&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;caps&quot;&gt;INFILE&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt; for example).  If you were to load the default output, from redirecting the mysql client, back into mysql then you&amp;#8217;d end up with an unwanted header row and &lt;span class=&quot;caps&quot;&gt;NULL&lt;/span&gt; strings (or 0 for numeric columns) where you expected actual &lt;span class=&quot;caps&quot;&gt;NULL&lt;/span&gt; values.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It took us a while to figure this out so I thought it might be of some use to others.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

        <title>Another project - Public Swimming Pools in the UK</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;Not content with already having a &lt;a href=&quot;/articles/2008/02/18/what-ive-been-up-to-projects-and-ideas&quot;&gt;bunch of unfinished projects&lt;/a&gt; I thought I&amp;#8217;d embark upon another.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#8217;ve struggled in the past to find public swimming pools that I can use when staying in London.  I&amp;#8217;ve searched on multiple occasions and never really found anything useful so figured there was probably a gap waiting to be filled.  Interestingly, I think that someone in or around the government must realise this too.  A search, on google, for &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.google.co.uk/search?q=uk+public+swimming+pools&quot;&gt;uk public swimming pools&lt;/a&gt; results in an &lt;a href=&quot;http://adwords.google.com&quot;&gt;Adword&lt;/a&gt; for &lt;a href=&quot;http://direct.gov.uk&quot;&gt;DirectGov&lt;/a&gt; that takes you to a page promoting the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.activeplaces.com&quot;&gt;Active Places&lt;/a&gt; website.  This website allows you to search for leisure facilities by postcode or by clicking around a map.  As noted in my &lt;a href=&quot;http://del.icio.us/chrisjroos/url/0a078da5074a6c759210508c0bc6a60e&quot;&gt;del.icio.us note&lt;/a&gt;, I think this could be a valuable site but the current implementation is very very poor: Both from a usability and search engine friendly point of view (I can&amp;#8217;t help but wonder, as it appears to be a Government funded project, through Sport England, how much money has been spent on it).  One last point about the site is that it appears to include data about pools that can&amp;#8217;t actually be used by members of the public (a pool belonging to a local private school appears when searching for pools near home).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;According to this &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.theyworkforyou.com/wrans/?id=2008-03-10b.192802.h&quot;&gt;parliamentary question&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.culture.gov.uk/&quot;&gt;department for Culture, Media and Sport&lt;/a&gt; know the number and type of pools opened and closed since 2004: actually, I&amp;#8217;ve just noticed that they appear to rely on the Active Places database.  There&amp;#8217;s an email address (actually, a Sport England address) on the Active Places website that I&amp;#8217;m going to use to see if I can get hold of this data.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The initial, and most basic, site will just list all the public swimming pools and, I&amp;#8217;m hoping this is pretty easy with the &lt;a href=&quot;http://code.google.com/apis/maps/&quot;&gt;Google Maps &lt;span class=&quot;caps&quot;&gt;API&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, allow you to search for one by location.  As, and indeed if, the site evolves, I&amp;#8217;d like to get lots more useful information about these pools up: I&amp;#8217;m hoping that allowing users to comment will reveal useful info about the best times to visit depending on what you&amp;#8217;re trying to get out of it.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

        <title>Reference Trackback Server implementation</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;To aid my development of the &lt;a href=&quot;/blog/2008-03-04-version-0-2-of-the-del-icio-us-trackback-extension&quot;&gt;del.icio.us trackbacks firefox extension&lt;/a&gt; I created a reference &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trackback&quot;&gt;trackback&lt;/a&gt; server implementation based on the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.sixapart.com/pronet/docs/trackback_spec&quot;&gt;trackback specification&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#8217;s written in &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.ruby-lang.org&quot;&gt;Ruby&lt;/a&gt; as a &lt;a href=&quot;http://mongrel.rubyforge.org/&quot;&gt;Mongrel&lt;/a&gt; handler and stores the trackbacks serialized to &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/YAML&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;caps&quot;&gt;YAML&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt; on the filesystem.  The code is over in &lt;a href=&quot;http://code.google.com/p/chrisroos/&quot;&gt;my google code repository&lt;/a&gt; (no direct link as I plan to move the trackback-server from its current home in /trunk/scratch to /trunk/www/trackbacks.seagul.co.uk).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On the off-chance that someone else might find it useful I&amp;#8217;m currently hosting it at &lt;a href=&quot;http://trackbacks.seagul.co.uk&quot;&gt;http://trackbacks.seagul.co.uk&lt;/a&gt;.  You might use it to see the del.icio.us trackbacks extension in action or to test the sending of trackbacks from your blog (the trackback &lt;span class=&quot;caps&quot;&gt;URL&lt;/span&gt; is &lt;a href=&quot;http://trackbacks.seagul.co.uk/trackback&quot;&gt;http://trackbacks.seagul.co.uk/trackback&lt;/a&gt;).  Or, you could just play with it using &lt;a href=&quot;http://curl.haxx.se&quot;&gt;curl&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class=&quot;code shell&quot;&gt;
# Let&#39;s just try to GET the trackback URL
$ curl http://trackbacks.seagul.co.uk/trackback
&amp;lt;?xml version=&quot;1.0&quot; encoding=&quot;utf-8&quot;?&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;response&amp;gt;
  &amp;lt;error&amp;gt;1&amp;lt;/error&amp;gt;
  &amp;lt;message&amp;gt;Http Method MUST be POST&amp;lt;/message&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;/response&amp;gt;

# OK, so we&#39;ll POST to the trackback URL
$ curl http://trackbacks.seagul.co.uk/trackback -X&quot;POST&quot;
&amp;lt;?xml version=&quot;1.0&quot; encoding=&quot;utf-8&quot;?&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;response&amp;gt;
  &amp;lt;error&amp;gt;1&amp;lt;/error&amp;gt;
  &amp;lt;message&amp;gt;Content-Type MUST be &#39;application/x-www-form-urlencoded&#39; with OPTIONAL character encoding&amp;lt;/message&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;/response&amp;gt;

# Posting with the correct Content-Type
$ curl http://trackbacks.seagul.co.uk/trackback -X&quot;POST&quot; -H&quot;Content-Type: application/x-wencoded&quot;
&amp;lt;?xml version=&quot;1.0&quot; encoding=&quot;utf-8&quot;?&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;response&amp;gt;
  &amp;lt;error&amp;gt;1&amp;lt;/error&amp;gt;
  &amp;lt;message&amp;gt;You MUST send the URL of your post (permalink) that mentions this post.&amp;lt;/message&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;/response&amp;gt;

# Post with the correct Content-Type and the required URL parameter to actually have a trackback created on the server
$ curl http://trackbacks.seagul.co.uk/trackback -X&quot;POST&quot; -H&quot;Content-Type: application/x-wencoded&quot; -d&quot;url=http://example.com&quot;
&amp;lt;?xml version=&quot;1.0&quot; encoding=&quot;utf-8&quot;?&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;response&amp;gt;
  &amp;lt;error&amp;gt;0&amp;lt;/error&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;/response&amp;gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;</description>

        <title>Files hosted on Google Groups cannot be opened in Safari (or Internet Explorer)</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;I noticed a little while ago that opening a, &lt;a href=&quot;http://groups.google.com&quot;&gt;Google Groups&lt;/a&gt; hosted, file in &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.apple.com/safari/&quot;&gt;Safari&lt;/a&gt; didn&amp;#8217;t work.  I have a file at &lt;a href=&quot;http://delicious-trackbacks.googlegroups.com/web/installation.html&quot;&gt;http://delicious-trackbacks.googlegroups.com/web/installation.html&lt;/a&gt; that you can try out if you&amp;#8217;re so inclined.  Requests for that file result in a page being rendered in Firefox but not in Safari or Internet Explorer (6 at least).  &lt;a href=&quot;http://interblah.net/&quot;&gt;James&lt;/a&gt; noticed that requests for these hosted files were resulting in a 302 response, as we can see from this &lt;a href=&quot;http://curl.haxx.se/&quot;&gt;curl&lt;/a&gt; output.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class=&quot;code shell&quot;&gt;
curl &quot;http://delicious-trackbacks.googlegroups.com/web/installation.html&quot; -v -X&quot;HEAD&quot;

&amp;lt; HTTP/1.1 302 Moved Temporarily
&amp;lt; Content-Type: text/html; charset=UTF-8
&amp;lt; Content-Length: 0
&amp;lt; Cache-control: private
&amp;lt; Server: GFE/1.3
&amp;lt; Date: Fri, 28 Mar 2008 19:55:58 GMT
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The response also includes a body that contains a link to the actual file you want with some kind of key in the querystring.  Interestingly the response doesn&amp;#8217;t return a Location header.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.w3.org/Protocols/rfc2616/rfc2616-sec10.html#sec10.3.3&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;caps&quot;&gt;HTTP&lt;/span&gt; specification&lt;/a&gt; states the following:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The temporary &lt;span class=&quot;caps&quot;&gt;URI&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;caps&quot;&gt;SHOULD&lt;/span&gt; be given by the Location field in the response. Unless the request method was &lt;span class=&quot;caps&quot;&gt;HEAD&lt;/span&gt;, the entity of the response &lt;span class=&quot;caps&quot;&gt;SHOULD&lt;/span&gt; contain a short hypertext note with a hyperlink to the new &lt;acronym title=&quot;s&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;caps&quot;&gt;URI&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/acronym&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, it looks like Google are sending a valid response according to the spec (although I&amp;#8217;m not sure whether they&amp;#8217;re intentionally leaving the Location header out) but that Safari and Internet Explorer are unable to deal with it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I found an existing report of &lt;a href=&quot;http://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=15822&quot;&gt;the bug&lt;/a&gt; over at the &lt;a href=&quot;http://webkit.org/&quot;&gt;webkit&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;http://bugs.webkit.org/&quot;&gt;bug tracker&lt;/a&gt; and added this information to it.  I also sent a &lt;a href=&quot;http://groups.google.com/group/Is-Something-Broken/browse_thread/thread/9e9a51c2b6841c8f/28088b462550858e#28088b462550858e&quot;&gt;message&lt;/a&gt; to the &lt;a href=&quot;http://groups.google.com/group/Google-Groups-Guide&quot;&gt;Google Groups: Is Something Broken&lt;/a&gt; group.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

        <title>Version Control Commit Note Best Practice (or not, you decide)</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;This is my own opinion but it has evolved from the need to dig back into past commit notes &lt;strong&gt;a lot&lt;/strong&gt;.  The lazy approach to writing commit notes is just to explain what&amp;#8217;s in the changeset (much like a code comment that says &amp;#8220;set x to 1&amp;#8221;):  It&amp;#8217;s exactly what I used to write (and still do if I&amp;#8217;m not concentrating).  The more useful approach is to explain why the changeset is there.  I can take two of my own commit notes as examples.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Useless commit note&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Capistrano deploy:setup should generate apache proxy cluster configuration.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is a fairly useless commit note: If I was to come back to this (as I did today when looking at it) I would have no idea what I was trying to achieve.  Why should the config be generated at setup and not at some other point in the deploy process?  If I&amp;#8217;d spent an extra 30 seconds writing the note in the first place I wouldn&amp;#8217;t have to try to work out what I was trying to achieve.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;More useful commit note&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This isn&#39;t a card but _has_ been bugging me for a long time. You can now click on the &lt;product_type&gt; in the &#39;Top 3 &lt;product_type&gt;&#39; headings on super category pages to visit that product type. Oh, I also made them h2s as having multiple h1s on a page just doesn&#39;t make sense.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is a much more useful (imho) comment.  If at some point in the future we want to know why the &amp;#8216;top 3 product types&amp;#8217; is now a link, we can come back to the note and see that it was because I, personally, was fed up of it not being so.  I also explain why I&amp;#8217;ve changed the heading from a h1 to h2 (although that comment could be open to interpretation: why doesn&amp;#8217;t it make sense?).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This all ties into submitting small checkins that are only doing one thing, but I might try to give some examples of that separately.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Anyone else have any thoughts or alternative approaches?&lt;/p&gt;</description>

        <title>Version 0.2 of the del.icio.us trackback extension</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;I finally got round to compiling the &lt;a href=&quot;/blog/2008-02-04-sending-trackbacks-to-the-sites-that-you-bookmark-in-del-icio-us&quot;&gt;del.icio.us trackback extension&lt;/a&gt; I wrote about a while back.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You can install it from the installation.html&lt;sup class=&quot;footnote&quot; id=&quot;fnr1&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn1&quot;&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; page on the &lt;a href=&quot;http://groups.google.com/group/delicious-trackbacks&quot;&gt;del.icio.us trackbacks google group&lt;/a&gt;.  Feel free to use that group to post any questions you have too.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Current features:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Scans the html of the page you&amp;#8217;re bookmarking looking for a link (anchor) with a rel attribute whose value is trackback.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Sends a request to the trackback &lt;span class=&quot;caps&quot;&gt;URI&lt;/span&gt; if it was found.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Records (by adding the &amp;#8216;dtb-sent&amp;#8217; tag) the sending of the trackback so that we can avoid sending multiple trackbacks to the same site.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Records the success (&amp;#8216;dtb-success&amp;#8217; tag) or failure (&amp;#8216;dtb-failure&amp;#8217;) of the trackback request.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That&amp;#8217;s all for now.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;footnote&quot; id=&quot;fn1&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fnr1&quot;&gt;&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/a&gt; I don&amp;#8217;t appear to be able to link directly to that page which is a bit odd.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

        <title>National Rail Train Times by SMS (again)</title>
        <description>&lt;div class=&quot;notice&quot;&gt;This service is no longer running.  Please see &lt;a href=&quot;/blog/2009-01-31-turning-off-my-national-rail-twitter-bot&quot;&gt;this post&lt;/a&gt; if you&amp;#8217;re interested to find out why.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A while back I &lt;a href=&quot;/blog/2007-07-24-train-times-by-sms-or-improving-national-rail-enquiries&quot;&gt;hacked&lt;/a&gt; a simple &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Short_message_service&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;caps&quot;&gt;SMS&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt; interface onto the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.nationalrail.co.uk/&quot;&gt;national rail enquiries&lt;/a&gt; website.  It turned out to be more gimmicky than functional and I left it to die.  Over the past couple of weeks I&amp;#8217;ve found myself, once again, in need of such a service and so spent a couple of hours last night reviving it: making it work, making it simpler and tidying the code.  The previous interface required the source station and destination station as well as the date and time of travel.  The format was very strict (requiring you to use the unique three digit station codes) and, as I found, overly complex (I could never remember what it was).  All I really wanted to do was specify the source and destination stations and get a list of the next few departures/arrival times.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The new interface is simply in the format of SOURCE_STATION to DESTINATION_STATION.  So, to find the next few trains from &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ramsgate_railway_station&quot;&gt;Ramsgate&lt;/a&gt; to &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Waterloo_East_railway_station&quot;&gt;London Waterloo East&lt;/a&gt; we can send the following &lt;a href=&quot;http://help.twitter.com/index.php?pg=kb.page&amp;amp;id=15&quot;&gt;direct message&lt;/a&gt; to the &lt;a href=&quot;http://twitter.com/natrailenq&quot;&gt;natrailenq&lt;/a&gt; user on &lt;a href=&quot;http://twitter.com&quot;&gt;twitter&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class=&quot;code&quot;&gt;
d natrailenq ramsgate to london waterloo east
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Although you can now use the full station name it will only, currently, work if you know the exact name of the station (so, waterloo east wouldn&amp;#8217;t work in that above example, but london waterloo east will).  It will still work if you supply the three digit station code.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In order to use this service, you will need to create a twitter account, &lt;a href=&quot;http://twitter.com/help/follow&quot;&gt;follow&lt;/a&gt; the natrailenq user and enable &lt;span class=&quot;caps&quot;&gt;SMS&lt;/span&gt; notifications from natrailenq.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

        <title>Tagging my del.icio.us bookmarks with the domain of the URL that I'm bookmarking</title>
        <description>&lt;div class=&quot;notice&quot;&gt;28-Apr-2009.  This is now a firefox extension hosted at &lt;a href=&quot;https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/11660&quot;&gt;addons.mozilla.org&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#8217;ve created another &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.mozilla.com/firefox&quot;&gt;firefox&lt;/a&gt; extension that builds on the &lt;a href=&quot;http://del.icio.us&quot;&gt;del.icio.us&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/3615&quot;&gt;extension&lt;/a&gt;.  This one finds the domain of the &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uniform_Resource_Locator&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;caps&quot;&gt;URL&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt; you&amp;#8217;re bookmarking and adds it as a tag to your bookmark.  It&amp;#8217;s basically just a copy of my &lt;a href=&quot;/blog/2007-12-18-extracting-my-del-icio-us-permalinks-functionality-into-its-own-firefox-extension&quot;&gt;del.icio.us permalinks extension&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To install this extension head over to the &lt;a href=&quot;http://groups.google.com/group/delicious-domain-tags&quot;&gt;delicious domain tags google group&lt;/a&gt; and visit the installation page (I don&amp;#8217;t seem to be able to link directly to it for some reason).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I came across an interesting problem when trying to get both this and the del.icio.us permalinks extension working together.  Both of the extensions modify the onload attribute of the add bookmark dialog.  When I only had the del.icio.us permalinks extension I was hardcoding the onload attribute to call my function (deliciousPermalinks.addPermalinkTag()) and the original function (yAddBookMark.init()).  This approach fell down as soon as I had two extensions trying to modify the onload attribute: I didn&amp;#8217;t know which extension would be loaded first and therefore one was always overwriting the other.  I&amp;#8217;m sure there&amp;#8217;s a nice way to do this but I hacked together a noddy initialisation script that finds the existing value of the onload attribute and adds to it with the relevant function.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class=&quot;code javascript&quot;&gt;
var yAddBookmarkDialog = document.getElementById(&#39;dlg_AddYBookMark&#39;);
var yAddBookmarkOnload = yAddBookmarkDialog.getAttribute(&#39;onload&#39;);
var onload = &#39;deliciousPermalinks.addPermalinkTag()&#39;;
yAddBookmarkDialog.setAttribute(&#39;onload&#39;, [yAddBookmarkOnload, onload].join(&#39;;&#39;))
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I reference this script in my &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/XUL&quot;&gt;xul&lt;/a&gt; file which causes it to be evaluated at (I guess) browser start time and the onload event to be modified correctly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#8217;ve updated the del.icio.us permalinks extension too but I think you&amp;#8217;ll need to remove and re-add it again from the &lt;a href=&quot;https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/11664&quot;&gt;installation page&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

        <title>What I've been up to - Projects and Ideas</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#8217;ve been a bit quiet on the blogging front (to be fair, I&amp;#8217;ve always been a bit slack) but I think it&amp;#8217;s for good reason: I&amp;#8217;ve re-discovered a love for programming, and in particular, creating things that I (and hopefully others) find useful.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, as a bit of an update, and a bit of a reminder for me, I thought I&amp;#8217;d list all the things I&amp;#8217;m either working on or thinking about.  Feel free to ask questions in the comments or by emailing me (chris at this domain).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Projects&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Atom (like &lt;span class=&quot;caps&quot;&gt;RSS&lt;/span&gt;) feed for thisiskent news content&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#8217;m interested in reading news articles from the local area but the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.thisiskent.co.uk&quot;&gt;thisiskent website&lt;/a&gt; doesn&amp;#8217;t provide a feed for me to subscribe to.  I&amp;#8217;ve created a little project that scrapes the news content from that site and produces a feed.  The feed is currently at &lt;a href=&quot;http://seagul.co.uk/thisiskent-thanet.atom&quot;&gt;http://seagul.co.uk/thisiskent-thanet.atom&lt;/a&gt; but will possibly move in the future.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;The Local Paper&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I wanted to give each article, in our local papers, a permalink so that people had a way to reference an article they were talking about.  I&amp;#8217;ve started building the site over at &lt;a href=&quot;http://the-local-paper.co.uk&quot;&gt;http://the-local-paper.co.uk&lt;/a&gt;.  There&amp;#8217;s a long way to go but I really wanted to start getting some content up so that I had more incentive to continue.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Sending trackbacks to pages that I bookmark in &lt;a href=&quot;http://del.icio.us&quot;&gt;del.icio.us&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I asked for this a while back in the &lt;a href=&quot;http://tech.groups.yahoo.com/group/ydn-delicious/message/1447&quot;&gt;del.icio.us group&lt;/a&gt;.  It occurred to me that I could add the functionality myself to the &lt;a href=&quot;https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/3615&quot;&gt;del.icio.us firefox extension&lt;/a&gt;, so I did.  It&amp;#8217;s more of a proof of concept at the moment but you can follow &lt;a href=&quot;/articles/2008/02/04/sending-trackbacks-to-the-sites-that-you-bookmark-in-del-icio-us&quot;&gt;these instructions&lt;/a&gt; if you wish to try it out.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Adding &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Permalink&quot;&gt;permalinks&lt;/a&gt; to del.icio.us bookmarks&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This was the precursor to the trackbacks project above.  I&amp;#8217;ve created a firefox extension that, building on the del.icio.us extension, adds a &amp;#8216;permalink tag&amp;#8217; to each bookmark you create.  You can read more &lt;a href=&quot;/articles/2007/12/18/extracting-my-del-icio-us-permalinks-functionality-into-its-own-firefox-extension&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt; or visit the &lt;a href=&quot;http://delicious-permalinks.googlegroups.com/web/installation.html&quot;&gt;installation page&lt;/a&gt; to install the extension.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Some blogging software&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I decided that I really didn&amp;#8217;t need the overhead of &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.typosphere.org/&quot;&gt;typo&lt;/a&gt; to produce what is essentially a static site.  The result is some software that produces the website that you&amp;#8217;re reading now.  I actually need to get some work done on this because I&amp;#8217;m currently in a position where it&amp;#8217;s harder for me to add content now than it used to be with typo.  D&amp;#8217;oh.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;An &lt;span class=&quot;caps&quot;&gt;SMS&lt;/span&gt; service to lookup train information&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#8217;ve built a service on top of &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.twitter.com&quot;&gt;twitter&lt;/a&gt; that allows you to request departure information.  This is actually live now (read the &lt;a href=&quot;/articles/2007/07/24/train-times-by-sms-or-improving-national-rail-enquiries&quot;&gt;instructions&lt;/a&gt;) but could be a lot more useful.  I&amp;#8217;ve found that my main use case is to find the next few trains from a specific station within the next half hour or so &amp;#8211; I&amp;#8217;m hoping to make the interface better suit this need.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Software to interface with banking websites and download/convert the data to &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.ofx.net/&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;caps&quot;&gt;OFX&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt; (for upload to &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.wesabe.com&quot;&gt;wesabe&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A while back, I got quite addicted to using wesabe in an attempt to manage my finances (as it happens I&amp;#8217;ve been very slack on this front too &amp;#8211; managing money is just boring).  I wrote some scripts to download data from my banks&amp;#8217; websites and additionally to convert that data to &lt;span class=&quot;caps&quot;&gt;OFX&lt;/span&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;A ruby implementation of &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.pwdhash.com&quot;&gt;pwdhash&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I wanted a command line version of the pwdhash tool.  I knocked up a ruby implementation but haven&amp;#8217;t really got round to making it command line friendly.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;A web service that converts a UK postcode to Latitude/Longitude&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It currently lives at &lt;a href=&quot;http://seagul.co.uk/postcodes&quot;&gt;http://seagul.co.uk/postcodes&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Ideas&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;A del.icio.us extension that mines del.icio.us (and magnolia etc) to find similar sites to those that I&amp;#8217;m looking at&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I did a fair bit of investigation into this, although I&amp;#8217;m not sure any of it is of any real use.  I was working on the theory that if the page I&amp;#8217;m looking at is tagged with, for example, &amp;#8216;train&amp;#8217;, &amp;#8216;uk&amp;#8217; and &amp;#8216;travel&amp;#8217; then other pages tagged in the same way would probably also be of interest.  Check the &lt;a href=&quot;http://chrisroos.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/delicious_similar_sites&quot;&gt;delicious_similar_sites&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;http://chrisroos.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/delicious-sidebar&quot;&gt;delicious-sidebar&lt;/a&gt; projects to check my progress.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;A hosted &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trackback&quot;&gt;trackback&lt;/a&gt; / &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pingback&quot;&gt;pingback&lt;/a&gt; service&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#8217;m thinking of something like &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.disqus.com&quot;&gt;disqus&lt;/a&gt; (hosted comments service) but for trackbacks/pingbacks.  I did find a site called &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.trackbackr.com&quot;&gt;trackbackr&lt;/a&gt; that would appear to offer something similar but I haven&amp;#8217;t looked into it in any detail.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;A hosted redirection service&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I want an easy way to create short/friendly URLs for a domain that I own.  I&amp;#8217;ve started exploring the possibility of a RESTful service to do just this.  There&amp;#8217;s some initial code over on &lt;a href=&quot;http://chrisroos.co.uk/code/mongrel-redirection&quot;&gt;google code&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Related posts: &lt;a href=&quot;/articles/2007/12/07/more-on-those-friendly-urls&quot;&gt;More on those friendly URLs&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;/articles/2007/11/27/short-human-friendly-permalinks&quot;&gt;Short, Human friendly, Permalinks&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;A mobile friendly version of the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.nationalrail.co.uk&quot;&gt;National Rail Enquiries&lt;/a&gt; website&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I need to check whether this is already covered by the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.traintimes.org.uk&quot;&gt;accessible national rails&lt;/a&gt; website.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;An &lt;span class=&quot;caps&quot;&gt;SMS&lt;/span&gt; alert with train information&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For three mornings a week, I get a regular train.  I&amp;#8217;d like to receive a text message, half an hour (or so) before I leave house, that tells me whether the train is running on time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;A receipt tagging application (del.icio.us for receipts)&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Until recently I had a lot of receipts stored on my email server.  This didn&amp;#8217;t feel like the right place for them so I&amp;#8217;ve placed them all on my laptop, in a folder that gets backed up to &lt;a href=&quot;http://aws.amazon.com/s3&quot;&gt;Amazon S3&lt;/a&gt; with the help of &lt;a href=&quot;http://jungledisk.com&quot;&gt;jungledisk&lt;/a&gt;.  I&amp;#8217;d like to be able to tag these receipts to make retrieval easier.  Ooh, I just had a thought &amp;#8211; I wonder if I could just bookmark their S3 &lt;span class=&quot;caps&quot;&gt;URL&lt;/span&gt; in del.icio.us&amp;#8230;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Some software to track my unsubscriptions&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Marketing emails annoy me.  I almost certainly don&amp;#8217;t want them.  More importantly, when I state that I don&amp;#8217;t want them, I want to have my wishes respected.  I knew that I was getting emails from companies that I&amp;#8217;d unsubscribed from and wanted to track the offenders.  I&amp;#8217;ve been using the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.stikipad.com&quot;&gt;stikipad&lt;/a&gt; wiki to do this but it&amp;#8217;s not exactly ideal.  I&amp;#8217;d like a service that will collect these emails (I&amp;#8217;m thinking that I&amp;#8217;ll forward them straight there) and report on those naughty companies that keep spamming me.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;A firefox extension/&lt;a href=&quot;https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/748&quot;&gt;greasemonkey&lt;/a&gt; script to determine the canonical &lt;span class=&quot;caps&quot;&gt;URL&lt;/span&gt; of a resource&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At one stage I was trying to use del.icio.us to manage the stuff I had for sale on &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.ebay.co.uk&quot;&gt;ebay&lt;/a&gt;.  Unfortunately, ebay is a bit naughty with their URLs (the same item for sale is available at different URLs) which meant I could end up bookmarking one &lt;span class=&quot;caps&quot;&gt;URL&lt;/span&gt; and then not find my bookmark notes again &amp;#8211; even though I knew I was looking at the same item.  I figure that we could maintain a list of rules that allow you to turn any &lt;span class=&quot;caps&quot;&gt;URL&lt;/span&gt; into its canonical version.  This wouldn&amp;#8217;t be ebay specific.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;A website with lots of info about swimming pools&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#8217;ve found it quite hard to find swimming pools close to work in the past.  I&amp;#8217;d like a site that has a map of all swimming pools in the local area along with info (opening times, costs) and reviews of those pools (when&amp;#8217;s a good time to go).&lt;/p&gt;</description>

        <title>Atom (like RSS) feeds for thisiskent.co.uk news stories</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#8217;ve only recently discovered that thisiskent.co.uk (the website of three of our local newspapers) place their &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.thisiskent.co.uk/displayNode.jsp?nodeId=250478&amp;amp;command=newPage&quot;&gt;news content&lt;/a&gt; online.  Unfortunately they&amp;#8217;ve neglected to provide &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RSS&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;caps&quot;&gt;RSS&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atom_%28standard%29&quot;&gt;Atom&lt;/a&gt; feeds which means that I don&amp;#8217;t get to see it (visiting websites is soooo old school).  As I&amp;#8217;m kinda interested in reading this news, I&amp;#8217;ve put something together that creates a feed from their news articles.  The feed currently lives at http://seagul.co.uk/thisiskent-thanet.atom although this will probably move in the future.  Feel free to subscribe to the feed and please leave comments if it&amp;#8217;s not working for you.  I&amp;#8217;m currently only interested in the Thanet news section but I&amp;#8217;d be happy to produce a feed for other areas if people are interested.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The code&amp;#8217;s over on &lt;a href=&quot;http://chrisroos.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/thisis-rss/&quot;&gt;google code&lt;/a&gt; if you want to see how it all works.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

        <title>Sending trackbacks to the sites that you bookmark in del.icio.us</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;I know they have their problems (I had 26 good and 38428 spam when they were enabled on my site) but I&amp;#8217;ve always liked the idea of &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trackback&quot;&gt;trackbacks&lt;/a&gt; (and the &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pingback&quot;&gt;pingback&lt;/a&gt; alternative).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A few months back I started thinking about &lt;a href=&quot;http://tech.groups.yahoo.com/group/ydn-delicious/message/1447&quot;&gt;sending trackbacks when bookmarking pages in del.icio.us&lt;/a&gt;.  Having been told that, although it was something that had been considered, it wasn&amp;#8217;t likely to be added anytime soon I decided to take a look at adding the functionality myself.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.sixapart.com/pronet/docs/trackback_spec&quot;&gt;trackback specification&lt;/a&gt; states that I must send the &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Permalink&quot;&gt;permalink&lt;/a&gt; of my &amp;#8216;post&amp;#8217; to the resource that I&amp;#8217;m tracking back to.  By design, individual posts (or bookmarks) in &lt;a href=&quot;http://del.icio.us&quot;&gt;del.icio.us&lt;/a&gt; aren&amp;#8217;t addressable by a &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uniform_Resource_Identifier&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;caps&quot;&gt;URI&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.  So, the first step was to &lt;a href=&quot;/blog/2007-09-04-permalinks-for-del-icio-us-bookmarks-posts&quot;&gt;add permalinks to my del.icio.us bookmarks&lt;/a&gt;.  This was a kludgy, manual fix that added permalinks to all my old bookmarks: it didn&amp;#8217;t work for any new bookmarks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;From here, I spent some time &lt;a href=&quot;/blog/2007-09-05-patching-the-del-icio-us-firefox-extension-to-add-permalinks&quot;&gt;hacking around with the del.icio.us firefox extension&lt;/a&gt; to get it to automatically generate these permalink tags.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The final stage was to &lt;a href=&quot;/blog/2007-12-18-extracting-my-del-icio-us-permalinks-functionality-into-its-own-firefox-extension&quot;&gt;extract the hacked-in functionality into its own extension&lt;/a&gt; (an extension of an extension &amp;#8211; cool huh).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Somehow, it took until about a month ago for me to realise that I now had everything in place to actually add trackback support to the &lt;a href=&quot;https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/3615&quot;&gt;del.icio.us firefox extension&lt;/a&gt;.  I started looking at it last week and I&amp;#8217;ve just finish up the proof of concept this morning.  At present, it scans the page you&amp;#8217;re bookmarking looking for an anchor tag with rel=trackback (because this is easier than trying to parse the &lt;span class=&quot;caps&quot;&gt;RDF&lt;/span&gt;).  If it finds one then it uses the url-tag from the &lt;a href=&quot;http://groups.google.com/group/delicious-permalinks&quot;&gt;del.icio.us permalinks&lt;/a&gt; extension to construct the permalink for your (to-be-created) bookmark and promptly goes off to send a trackback.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The code is over in my &lt;a href=&quot;http://chrisroos.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/delicious-trackbacks/&quot;&gt;google code repository&lt;/a&gt;.  It&amp;#8217;s very rough around the edges so I&amp;#8217;m holding off providing a compiled version just yet.  If you really want to play along then you can follow these steps:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Install the del.icio.us firefox extension (to be fair, I&amp;#8217;m going to assume that you&amp;#8217;re probably at this stage already)&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Install the del.icio.us permalinks extension&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Checkout out the del.icio.us trackbacks source&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Find your Firefox extensions directory&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Create a textfile called delicious-trackbacks@googlegroups.com&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Add the path to the checked out project del.icio.us trackbacks project to this textfile&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Restart firefox&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Hope it all works and doesn&amp;#8217;t destroy your computer :-)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Oh, and I&amp;#8217;ve created a real simple &lt;a href=&quot;http://chrisroos.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/scratch/trackback-server/&quot;&gt;trackback server&lt;/a&gt; (well, a &lt;a href=&quot;http://mongrel.rubyforge.org/&quot;&gt;mongrel&lt;/a&gt; handler) and a dummy page that includes a link to this server so that you can see the trackbacks being sent.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

        <title>Migration from Typo to a static site is complete</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#8217;m tired so I&amp;#8217;ll keep this short&amp;#8230;  If you can see this post then it means that I haven&amp;#8217;t broken anything (well, it means I haven&amp;#8217;t broken the rss feed anyway).  I still have lots to do but &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eat_one&amp;#39;s_own_dog_food&quot;&gt;eating my own dogfood&lt;/a&gt; should give me a reason to keep improving.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

        <title>Migrating this blog from Typo to a static site</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#8217;m in the process of migrating this site from &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.typosphere.org/&quot;&gt;typo&lt;/a&gt; to a bunch of static pages.  I aim to get the static site deployed this evening.  I&amp;#8217;ll post again when I&amp;#8217;ve migrated.  If any &lt;span class=&quot;caps&quot;&gt;RSS&lt;/span&gt; subscribers out there don&amp;#8217;t see a new post this evening, or tomorrow morning, then it means that I&amp;#8217;ve failed to get it deployed or that it&amp;#8217;s deployed and I&amp;#8217;ve screwed up&amp;#8230;. That&amp;#8217;s all for now.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Oh and the code is in the &lt;a href=&quot;http://chrisroos.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/migrate-typo-to-static-site/&quot;&gt;usual place&lt;/a&gt; if you fancy following along.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

        <title>Emailing photos to flickr from my Skypephone</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;I wanted to get my thoughts down more than trying to write something particularly coherent so I apologise for the unstructured post.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#8217;ve been trying to get this working for the last week or so, without much success.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The first problem I ran into was my general impatience and incompetence.  I was able to receive emails to my 3mail.com address but sending of emails was not working (attachment or not).  I struggled alone for a bit before heading for the instruction manual and realising that I hadn&amp;#8217;t actually configured my email settings.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I needed to change the username (from the default &amp;#8216;3Mail&amp;#8217; to my mobile number) and the password (to the four digit code set-up at some point during the enrollment process).  I also changed the Mail address to my 3mail.com address but I&amp;#8217;m not sure whether this was necessary or not.  Changing these settings allowed me to send email (I started by emailing my personal account).  As I was successfully receiving emails before these changes I can only assume that the username and password are required for &lt;span class=&quot;caps&quot;&gt;SMTP&lt;/span&gt; and that &lt;span class=&quot;caps&quot;&gt;IMAP&lt;/span&gt; authentication happens in some other, magical, way.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The 3mail service appears to use standard &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet_Message_Access_Protocol&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;caps&quot;&gt;IMAP&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt; (imap.three.co.uk) and &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SMTP&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;caps&quot;&gt;SMTP&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt; servers but I&amp;#8217;m guessing that access is restricted by IP address.  I certainly couldn&amp;#8217;t access them from my laptop on the end of an &lt;span class=&quot;caps&quot;&gt;ADSL&lt;/span&gt; connection.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I was monitoring the costs of the emails being sent and soon realised that every email that included a picture cost fifty pence.  I sent a simple text email with a tiny subject and body and it didn&amp;#8217;t affect my credit at all so I&amp;#8217;m not entirely sure of their charging model (it could be that I pay for attachments or just messages over a certain size).  I wondered whether the data used in sending the email would come out of an Internet bundles.  I purchased a fifty pence, one day, Internet bundle and sent another message: my credit decreased by fifty pence again.  D&amp;#8217;oh.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It might be useful to note that you can send one email to multiple recipients (I tried two) for the same price (fifty pence for the email with picture that I was sending).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I emailed the same photo to &lt;a href=&quot;http://flickr.com&quot;&gt;flickr&lt;/a&gt; twice, cc&amp;#8217;ing my personal address one occasion.  Neither email made it to flickr (well, it&amp;#8217;s difficult to know that for sure but it certainly didn&amp;#8217;t show up) but the email cc&amp;#8217;d to me came through fine.  To ensure that &amp;#8216;email to flickr&amp;#8217; was working correctly, I sent the picture I&amp;#8217;d just received to my flickr email address (copied from the email) and it &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.flickr.com/photos/chrisjroos/2199297357/&quot;&gt;showed up&lt;/a&gt; almost immediately.  Hmm, so I&amp;#8217;ve now wasted a couple of quid and still can&amp;#8217;t email my photos to flickr.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I was able to send the message as a picture message to flickr (and my personal email) at a cost of twenty-five pence.  There are two (smallish) downsides to this approach: the pictures are resized to 640&amp;#215;480 before sending and, as it goes through an &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multimedia_Messaging_Service&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;caps&quot;&gt;MMS&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt; to email translation phase, the email you receive doesn&amp;#8217;t have the subject and body set correctly (&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.flickr.com/photos/chrisjroos/2199389895/&quot;&gt;screenshot&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;</description>

        <title>Testing my mod_rewrite configuration with ruby</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;In order to ensure that I didn&amp;#8217;t break anything while setting up my &lt;a href=&quot;/blog/2008-01-16-chris-1-mod_rewrite-0-muhahahaha&quot;&gt;mod_rewrite rules&lt;/a&gt; I created a little &lt;a href=&quot;http://chrisroos.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/the-local-paper/apache_test.rb&quot;&gt;ruby script&lt;/a&gt; to test my expectations.  I&amp;#8217;ve cut down the rules in the example below but you should get the idea.  It&amp;#8217;d be quite cool to create a little dsl to better express the intentions of the code.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class=&quot;code ruby&quot;&gt;
require &#39;net/http&#39;

expectations = {
  # Redirect www. to .
  &#39;http://www.the-local-paper.co.uk/&#39; =&amp;gt; {
    :url =&amp;gt; &#39;http://the-local-paper.co.uk/&#39;, :code =&amp;gt; &#39;301&#39;
  },
  # Requests for the-local-paper.co.uk should return a 200 (OK) response
  &#39;http://the-local-paper.co.uk/&#39; =&amp;gt; {
    :code =&amp;gt; &#39;200&#39;
  }
}

expectations.each do |request_url, expected_attributes|
  puts &quot;Requesting: #{request_url}&quot;

  url = URI.parse(request_url)
  request = Net::HTTP::Get.new(url.path)
  response = Net::HTTP.start(url.host, url.port) do |http|
    http.request(request)
  end

  if redirection_url = expected_attributes[:url]
    raise &quot;Expected &#39;#{redirection_url}&#39; in the Location header but got &#39;#{response[&#39;Location&#39;]}&#39;.&quot; unless redirection_url == response[&#39;Location&#39;]
  end
  if status_code = expected_attributes[:code]
    raise &quot;Expected status code of (#{status_code}) but got (#{response.code}).&quot; unless status_code == response.code
  end
end
&lt;/pre&gt;</description>

        <title>Chris 1, mod_rewrite 0 (muhahahaha)</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#8217;ve now spent quite a considerable amount of time trying to get &lt;a href=&quot;http://httpd.apache.org/docs/1.3/mod/mod_rewrite.html&quot;&gt;mod_rewrite&lt;/a&gt; to do my bidding and I think I might just have cracked it&lt;sup class=&quot;footnote&quot; id=&quot;fnr1&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn1&quot;&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;The requirements&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Permanently redirect (301) and requests for www.the-local-paper.co.uk to the-local-paper.co.uk&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Permanently redirect any requests for &lt;code&gt;/index.html&lt;/code&gt; to &lt;code&gt;/&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Permanently redirect any requests for &lt;code&gt;/&amp;lt;article&amp;gt;.html&lt;/code&gt; to &lt;code&gt;/&amp;lt;article&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Render the corresponding &lt;code&gt;/&amp;lt;article&amp;gt;.html&lt;/code&gt; for any requests for &lt;code&gt;/&amp;lt;article&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Hide .svn directories as the entire site is checked out from &lt;a href=&quot;http://subversion.tigris.org/&quot;&gt;subversion&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;The mod_rewrite rules&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;pre class=&quot;code&quot;&gt;
# Permanently (301) redirect /index.html to / (regex copied from http://www.webmasterworld.com/apache/3155094.htm)
RewriteCond %{THE_REQUEST} ^[A-Z]{3,9}\ /.*index\.html\ HTTP/
RewriteRule ^(.*)index\.html$ $1 [R=301,L]

# Permanently (301) redirect /&amp;lt;article&amp;gt;.html to /&amp;lt;article&amp;gt;, ensuring that we don&#39;t try to redirect index.html to index
RewriteCond %{THE_REQUEST} .+/[0-9]{4}/[0-9]{2}/[0-9]{2}/.+\.html\ HTTP/
RewriteCond %{THE_REQUEST} !index\.html\ HTTP/
RewriteRule ^(.*)\.html$ $1 [R=301,L]

# If we receive a request for an article without a .html extension then let&#39;s rewrite internally to render the file with the .html extension
RewriteCond %{REQUEST_URI} .+/[0-9]{4}/[0-9]{2}/[0-9]{2}/.+$
RewriteCond %{REQUEST_URI} !\.html$
RewriteRule ^(.*)$ $1.html [L]

# Permanently (301) remove www.
RewriteCond %{HTTP_HOST} ^www.the-local-paper.co.uk$ [NC]
RewriteRule ^(.*)$ http://the-local-paper.co.uk/$1 [R=301,L]

# Block access to the .svn directories
&amp;lt;DirectoryMatch &quot;^/.*/\.svn/&quot;&amp;gt;
  ErrorDocument 403 /404.html
  Order allow,deny
  Deny from all
  Satisfy All
&amp;lt;/DirectoryMatch&amp;gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I figured that there&amp;#8217;s a chance some of these rules might come in useful to someone else.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;footnote&quot; id=&quot;fn1&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fnr1&quot;&gt;&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/a&gt; This has all been for the &lt;a href=&quot;/blog/2007-06-01-an-open-letter-to-my-local-newspapers&quot;&gt;local paper idea&lt;/a&gt; I mentioned a while back.  I&amp;#8217;ve actually &lt;a href=&quot;http://twitter.com/chrisroos/statuses/570937102&quot;&gt;started&lt;/a&gt; to get some content up on &lt;a href=&quot;http://the-local-paper.co.uk&quot;&gt;the-local-paper.co.uk&lt;/a&gt; if you want to play along and see how it&amp;#8217;s shaping up..&lt;/p&gt;</description>

        <title>Fun with mod_rewrite (and its special variables REQUEST_URI, IS_SUBREQ and THE_REQUEST)</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;I wasted a few hours of my life, over the weekend, playing with &lt;a href=&quot;http://httpd.apache.org/docs/1.3/mod/mod_rewrite.html&quot;&gt;mod_rewrite&lt;/a&gt;.  I had, what I thought to be, a fairly simple problem to solve: I wanted requests for index.html within any subdirectory of my site to be &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/URL_redirection&quot;&gt;redirected&lt;/a&gt; to the root of that subdirectory.  So, a request for example.com/subdir/index.html would be (301) redirected to example.com/subdir/.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I thought I could do this without using &lt;a href=&quot;http://httpd.apache.org/docs/1.3/mod/mod_rewrite.html#RewriteCond&quot;&gt;RewriteCond&lt;/a&gt;.  I tried something like this.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class=&quot;code&quot;&gt;
RewriteRule ^(.*)index\.html$ $1 [R=301]
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I would expect this to match requests for URLs that end with index.html and redirect them to the &lt;span class=&quot;caps&quot;&gt;URL&lt;/span&gt; minus index.html.  Although this correctly redirected /subdir/index.html to /subdir/ it would also attempt to redirect /subdir/ to /subdir/ resulting in an infinite loop.  It took me a very long time to work out, what I believe, is going on.  If I understand correctly, &lt;a href=&quot;http://httpd.apache.org/&quot;&gt;apache&lt;/a&gt; will send every request (i.e. not just the request you issue from the browser) through mod_rewrite.  When we request /subdir/, apache will try, and fail, to match that &lt;span class=&quot;caps&quot;&gt;URL&lt;/span&gt; with our regex (/subdir/ doesn&amp;#8217;t end with index.html).  Internally, apache then &amp;#8216;requests&amp;#8217; index.html (since index.html is the &lt;a href=&quot;http://httpd.apache.org/docs/1.3/mod/mod_dir.html#directoryindex&quot;&gt;DirectoryIndex&lt;/a&gt;).  This request matches our regex which results in apache sending the 301 redirect and us ending up with an infinite loop.  If I mis-understand what&amp;#8217;s going on please feel free to correct me.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Based on this assumption, I figured I&amp;#8217;d need to use RewriteCond to somehow ignore the internal request for index.html.  I initially added a condition that checked for the REQUEST_URI ending in index.html (&lt;code&gt;RewriteCond %{REQUEST_URI} index\.html$&lt;/code&gt;).  This suffered the same problem as my initial attempt.  A little more reading led me to the IS_SUBREQ special variable.  I thought this might allow me to ignore the &amp;#8216;internal request&amp;#8217; for index.html (&lt;code&gt;RewriteCond %{IS_SUBREQ} false&lt;/code&gt;) but I couldn&amp;#8217;t get it to have any effect.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In searching for answers to this problem I kept seeing THE_REQUEST special variable used in the solution, although never an explanation as to why it&amp;#8217;s used (specifically in preference to REQUEST_URI).  I ended up using THE_REQUEST in my solution (not technically my solution as I stole it from a site that I failed to bookmark) and it seems to work OK.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class=&quot;code&quot;&gt;
RewriteCond %{THE_REQUEST} ^[A-Z]{3,9}\ /.*index\.html\ HTTP/
RewriteRule ^(.*)index\.html$ $1 [R=301,L]
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#8217;m guessing that this is because THE_REQUEST contains the full details (the stuff that appears in the log file) of the request from the client (browser) and will therefore be empty for any &amp;#8216;internal requests&amp;#8217;.  Anyone know if my assumptions are correct?&lt;/p&gt;</description>

        <title>Searching subversion history</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#8217;ve often felt the need to search through our &lt;a href=&quot;http://subversion.tigris.org/&quot;&gt;subversion&lt;/a&gt; repository to find, for example, when a method was removed/renamed.  As far as I&amp;#8217;m aware there&amp;#8217;s no easy way to do this using the standard subversion, or &lt;a href=&quot;http://trac.edgewall.org/&quot;&gt;trac&lt;/a&gt;, tools.  A few days ago the need arose once more: I wanted to know when a particular class had stopped being used within our codebase.  It struck me that if I had a &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diff&quot;&gt;diff&lt;/a&gt; file for each changeset that I&amp;#8217;d be able to &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grep&quot;&gt;grep&lt;/a&gt; for the change I was looking for.  I hacked together a script to produce a diff of each changeset (actually, as I knew when the class was added, I only produced a diff for a subset of the changesets) and was able to find the information I needed.  The script is pasted below and on &lt;a href=&quot;http://chrisroos.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/svn_changesets/&quot;&gt;google code&lt;/a&gt;.  It assumes that you are running it from within an svn working direction.  It took a while to produce the diff files (I&amp;#8217;m afraid I don&amp;#8217;t have any stats) but the result was a really fast way of finding, otherwise hard to find, information.  I guess it&amp;#8217;d be quite easy to automate the diff creation process so that you had an always up-to-date bunch of diff fies&amp;#8230;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Is this useful, or have I missed something obvious in Subversion or Trac that does exactly this?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class=&quot;code ruby&quot;&gt;
require &#39;fileutils&#39;

stop_at_revision = ARGV[0]
raise &quot;Please specify the revision that you wish to go back to as the only argument to this script.&quot; unless stop_at_revision
stop_at_revision = Integer(stop_at_revision)

class Time
  def friendly_format
    strftime(&quot;%Y-%m-%d %H:%M:%S&quot;)
  end
end

def msg(message)
  puts &quot;#{Time.now.friendly_format} - #{message}&quot;
end

def produce_diff(revisions, earlier_revision = nil)
  if revisions.empty?
    msg &quot;All finished.&quot;
    exit
  end

  later_revision = earlier_revision ? earlier_revision : revisions.shift
  earlier_revision = revisions.shift

  msg &quot;Creating diff from revision #{earlier_revision} to #{later_revision}.&quot;
  `svn diff -r#{earlier_revision}:#{later_revision} &amp;gt; patches/#{later_revision}.patch`
  produce_diff(revisions, earlier_revision)
end

FileUtils.mkdir_p &#39;patches&#39;

msg &quot;Scanning output of svn log to find all revisions that we care about...&quot;
log = `svn log -rHEAD:#{stop_at_revision} -q`
revisions = log.scan(/^r(\d+)/)
revisions = revisions.flatten.collect { |revision| Integer(revision) }

produce_diff(revisions)
&lt;/pre&gt;</description>

        <title>Extracting my del.icio.us permalinks functionality into its own firefox extension</title>
        <description>&lt;div class=&quot;notice&quot;&gt;28-Apr-2009.  This is now a firefox extension hosted at &lt;a href=&quot;https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/11664&quot;&gt;addons.mozilla.org&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My &lt;a href=&quot;/blog/2007-09-05-patching-the-del-icio-us-firefox-extension-to-add-permalinks&quot;&gt;previous implementation&lt;/a&gt; amended the &lt;a href=&quot;https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/3615&quot;&gt;del.icio.us bookmarks extension&lt;/a&gt;.  I spent some time this morning, and evening, extracting the functionality into its own &lt;a href=&quot;http://chrisroos.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/firefox-extensions/delicious-permalinks/&quot;&gt;extension&lt;/a&gt;.  This should mean that I remain decoupled from their extension: I don&amp;#8217;t have to update, or even just apply, my original patch whenever the del.icio.us extension is changed.  It should also make it much easier for anyone else to try (if they so wish).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#8217;ve created a &lt;a href=&quot;http://groups.google.com/group/delicious-permalinks/&quot;&gt;google group&lt;/a&gt; if folks want to chat about it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To install the extension just visit the &lt;a href=&quot;https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/11664&quot;&gt;installation page&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

        <title>Cross browser (well, IE 6, Firefox 2 and Safari 3) bookmarklet script</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;I &lt;a href=&quot;/blog/2007-12-14-bookmarklet-favelet-limits-in-internet-explorer-6-and-7&quot;&gt;mentioned&lt;/a&gt; that I&amp;#8217;d been playing with bookmarklets in Internet Explorer 6 (among other, proper, browsers).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I thought it might be useful to paste the script that bootstraps the bookmarklet.  The concept is that we use the bookmarklet javascript to insert a script tag into the page that links to the full javascript file containing the function(s) that we wish to execute.  I know this has been documented elsewhere and I&amp;#8217;ve probably missed some important stuff out but it may prove useful to someone.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;The commented, un-compressed, version&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;pre class=&quot;code javascript&quot;&gt;
if (typeof(rvmBM) == &#39;undefined&#39;) { // Best to name rvmBM to something unlikely to clash with pre-defined variables
  var s = document.createElement(&#39;script&#39;); // Use of s versus script saves some precious space
  s.type = &#39;text/javascript&#39;;
  s.src = &#39;http://example.com/my-external-bookmarklet.js&#39;; // The location of your bookmarklet javascript that does all the work
  void(rvmBM = true); // Prevent the bookmarklet javascript from being loaded multiple times by setting this flag
  void(document.body.appendChild(s)); // Place the script tag in the body of the document
  // If we don&#39;t use void() above then we end up writing either &#39;true&#39; or some junk to the screen in Internet Explorer (only)
};
function addRvm() { // A wrapper function around the actual function we want to call
  if (typeof(addReevooMark) == &#39;function&#39;) { // We want to make sure our bookmarklet function is defined (there&#39;s some delay in it becoming available in Firefox.  It&#39;s defined immediately in Internet Explorer.)
    addReevooMark();
  } else {
    void(setTimeout(addRvm, 100)); // If our function isn&#39;t ready yet we&#39;ll just hang on 1/10th of a second and try again
  };
};
addRvm(); // Ask our wrapper function to call the actual bookmarklet function
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;The compressed version&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;pre class=&quot;code javascript&quot;&gt;
javascript:if(typeof(rvmBM)==&#39;undefined&#39;){var s=document.createElement(&#39;script&#39;);s.type=&#39;text/javascript&#39;;s.src=&#39;http://example.com/my-external-bookmarklet.js&#39;;void(rvmBM=true);void(document.body.appendChild(s));};function addRvm(){if(typeof(addReevooMark)==&#39;function&#39;){addReevooMark();}else{void(setTimeout(addRvm,100));};};addRvm();
&lt;/pre&gt;</description>

        <title>Web pages should specify their canonical URL (permalink)</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#8217;ve been using &lt;a href=&quot;http://del.icio.us&quot;&gt;del.icio.us&lt;/a&gt; to record items on &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.ebay.co.uk&quot;&gt;ebay&lt;/a&gt; that I&amp;#8217;m interested in.  The problem is that each ebay page can have multiple URLs &amp;#8211; none of which redirect to the canonical version.  I can end up tagging the same listing twice if I happen to visit it with two different URLs &amp;#8211; this is annoying.  It wouldn&amp;#8217;t be hard for them to either redirect to the canonical version or just add a &lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;link rel=&quot;bookmark&quot; ... /&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt; tag to the document.  This way, I could ensure that I was always bookmarking the same version (even modifying the del.icio.us plugin if necessary).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This isn&amp;#8217;t just a problem for ebay: lots of sites duplicate their content on multiple URLs (hello retailers).  Maybe in the short term we could come up with some rules for turning any given &lt;span class=&quot;caps&quot;&gt;URL&lt;/span&gt; on a specific site into its canonical representation.  That sounds like a nice, useful, little service to me.  Can someone build it for me please?&lt;/p&gt;</description>

        <title>Bookmarklet (Favelet) limits in Internet Explorer 6 (and 7?)</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Update &amp;#8211; 20th May 2011.&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.webdeavour.co.uk&quot;&gt;Lee&lt;/a&gt; was kind enough to email and point out the 505/508 character descrepency.  It&amp;#8217;s because of the three backslashes in the example.  Programmatically evaluating the length of &amp;#8220;\n&amp;#8221; in ruby correctly returns 1 as the \n is turned into a single newline.  This isn&amp;#8217;t what happens in my javascript though: To make the test better replicate what was happening in javascript I should&amp;#8217;ve used single quotes so that &amp;#8216;\n&amp;#8217; is indeed recognised as 2 characters.  In addition, re-reading this post made me realise that my original test wasn&amp;#8217;t exactly as simple as it could be (what with all the spaces and newlines) so I created a &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/chrisroos/bookmarklet-generator&quot;&gt;crappy html/javascript bookmarklet generator&lt;/a&gt; to more accurately test the limits on bookmarklet lengths.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I wasted quite a bit of time over the last couple of days trying to get a &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bookmarklet&quot;&gt;bookmarklet&lt;/a&gt; (or favelet) working in Internet Explorer 6.  It worked perfectly in Firefox and Safari but wasn&amp;#8217;t doing anything at all in IE.  Through lots of trial and error, I came to the conclusion that it was because of the length of the bookmarklet: it seems that Microsoft &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.squarefree.com/2005/01/12/internet-explorer-drops-support-for-bookmarklets/&quot;&gt;reduced the maximum length of a bookmarklet in IE 6&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Although my original bookmarklet wasn&amp;#8217;t all that long, I had it spread over multiple lines for readability.  The fix in my case was to remove all the spaces and place the bookmarklet on one line.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I started to think that it might be nice to have a bookmarklet &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.rubyonrails.com&quot;&gt;rails&lt;/a&gt; helper.  The bookmarklet helper would allow you to format your javascript for readability but shorten it all in the resulting html (it could even warn if the bookmarklet is too long for IE).  I couldn&amp;#8217;t find anything similar, and I probably won&amp;#8217;t get around to doing it myself, but I did decide to investigate the limit in IE (which could form the basis of such a helper).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I used the html page below to test the limits of Internet Explorer.  This is the longest bookmarklet that I could get to work: one more character (a 2 on the end of those numbers, for example) and the bookmarklet won&amp;#8217;t work (it still works if you click the link in the page &amp;#8211; it only fails when used as an actual bookmarklet).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class=&quot;code html&quot;&gt;
&amp;lt;!DOCTYPE html PUBLIC &quot;-//W3C//DTD HTML 4.01//EN&quot;&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;html&amp;gt;
  &amp;lt;head&amp;gt;
    &amp;lt;title&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/title&amp;gt;
  &amp;lt;/head&amp;gt;
  &amp;lt;body&amp;gt;
    &amp;lt;a href=&quot;javascript:
      var msg = &#39;hello world, this is my message.  i\&#39;m trying to see how long i can be until internet explorer blows up in my face.&#39;;
      var msg = msg + &#39;\n&#39;;
      var msg = msg + &#39;this is the second line of my long message&#39;;
      var msg = msg + &#39;\n&#39;;
      var msg = msg + &#39;12345679012345678901&#39;;
      alert(msg);&quot;&amp;gt;bookmarklet&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;
  &amp;lt;/body&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;/html&amp;gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I noticed that, once added to Internet Explorer, the bookmarklet appeared to be &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.blooberry.com/indexdot/html/topics/urlencoding.htm&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;caps&quot;&gt;URL&lt;/span&gt; encoded&lt;/a&gt; (my assumption was based on the conversion of spaces to %20.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.flickr.com/photos/chrisjroos/2109757023/&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2321/2109757023_0f69015c44.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I tried to replicate this encoded string in &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.ruby-lang.org&quot;&gt;ruby&lt;/a&gt; but failed:  A simple &lt;span class=&quot;caps&quot;&gt;URI&lt;/span&gt;.escape in ruby was escaping too much.  Inspecting the bookmarklet again seemed to suggest that the only encoding performed is to remove newlines and convert spaces to %20.  Replicating this in irb gave me the same string that Internet Explorer had in its favourites.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class=&quot;code ruby&quot;&gt;
irb) str = &quot;javascript:
  var msg = &#39;hello world, this is my message.  i\&#39;m trying to see how long i can be until internet explorer blows up in my face.&#39;;
  var msg = msg + &#39;\n&#39;;
  var msg = msg + &#39;this is the second line of my long message&#39;;
  var msg = msg + &#39;\n&#39;;
  var msg = msg + &#39;12345679012345678901&#39;;
  alert(msg);&quot;
irb) p str.gsub(&quot;&#39;\n&#39;&quot;, &quot;&#39;--NEW-LINE--&#39;&quot;).gsub(&quot;\n&quot;, &#39;&#39;).gsub(&quot;&#39;--NEW-LINE--&#39;&quot;, &quot;&#39;\n&#39;&quot;).gsub(&#39; &#39;, &quot;%20&quot;).length
=&amp;gt; 505
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Everything I&amp;#8217;d read about these bookmarklets in Internet Explorer suggested that the limit was 508 characters: the length of the bookmarklet above (once encoded) is only 505 characters.  Adding one more character makes it fail as a bookmarklet.  Hmm, maybe I&amp;#8217;m doing something dumb?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#8217;ve cheated a bit in the &amp;#8216;encoding&amp;#8217; above.  IE removes all newlines (I wonder if this happens in the &lt;span class=&quot;caps&quot;&gt;DOM&lt;/span&gt; or just when you add it as a favourite?) so that the bookmarklet appears on one line.  I needed to do the same but also needed those newlines in the msg to remain (hence the &lt;span class=&quot;caps&quot;&gt;NEW&lt;/span&gt;-&lt;span class=&quot;caps&quot;&gt;LINE&lt;/span&gt; replacement stuff).  This is a very naive imlpementation: if you have &amp;#8216;\n\n&amp;#8217;, for example, then it breaks.  The &amp;#8216;encoding&amp;#8217; would need to be a little more intelligent in an actual helper (but only if you wanted to report on the size of the bookmarklet).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I couldn&amp;#8217;t find any reference to source of this 508 character limit in Internet Explorer: all the blog articles just state it as fact.  So, maybe it&amp;#8217;s not 508.  Maybe it&amp;#8217;s actually 505&amp;#8230;&lt;/p&gt;</description>

        <title>Testing ActionMailer::Base.server_settings</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;I needed to use an external &lt;span class=&quot;caps&quot;&gt;SMTP&lt;/span&gt; server to get mail through to certain providers (notably, hotmail).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I was sending my &lt;a href=&quot;http://api.rubyonrails.org/classes/ActionMailer/Base.html&quot;&gt;action mailer&lt;/a&gt; email but couldn&amp;#8217;t be sure that I&amp;#8217;d configured the settings correctly as I didn&amp;#8217;t get any detailed log output (or at least not where I was looking).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I dug into the code and found the lines that were responsible for sending the email.  Replaying that code in the console allowed me to identify the problem immediately (a missing domain in my case).  I thought I&amp;#8217;d paste those few lines here in case they&amp;#8217;re of some use to someone else.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class=&quot;code ruby&quot;&gt;
message, from, to = &#39;test message&#39;, &#39;sender-email&#39;, &#39;recipient-email&#39;
s = ActionMailer::Base.server_settings
Net::SMTP.start(s[:address], s[:port], s[:domain], s[:user_name], s[:password], s[:authentication]) do |smtp|
  smtp.sendmail(message, from, to)
end
&lt;/pre&gt;</description>

&lt;p&gt;I had been using &lt;a href=&quot;http://httpd.apache.org/&quot;&gt;apache&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;http://httpd.apache.org/docs/1.3/mod/mod_rewrite.html&quot;&gt;mod_rewrite&lt;/a&gt; to redirect &amp;#8220;chrisroos.co.uk/amazonwishlist&amp;#8221; to my actual wishlist.  I had something like this in my apache config.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class=&quot;code&quot;&gt;
&amp;lt;VirtualHost *:80&amp;gt;
  ServerAdmin webmaster@seagul.co.uk
  ServerName chrisroos.co.uk
  ServerAlias www.chrisroos.co.uk
  RewriteEngine On
  # &amp;lt;anything&amp;gt;.chrisroos.co.uk -&amp;gt; chrisroos.co.uk
  RewriteCond %{HTTP_HOST} !^chrisroos.co.uk$ [NC]
  RewriteRule ^/(.*)$ http://chrisroos.co.uk/$1 [R=301,L]
  # Amazon Wishlist
  RewriteRule ^/amazonwishlist http://www.amazon.co.uk/gp/registry/IO9HVNCPEWGD [R]
&amp;lt;/VirtualHost&amp;gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#8217;ve replaced that with a much simpler apache config that proxies requests to my new &lt;a href=&quot;http://mongrel.rubyforge.org/&quot;&gt;mongrel&lt;/a&gt; redirection handler thing (&lt;a href=&quot;http://chrisroos.co.uk/code/mongrel-redirection&quot;&gt;source&lt;/a&gt; &amp;#8211; hey, even that &lt;span class=&quot;caps&quot;&gt;URL&lt;/span&gt; passes through my redirection service).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class=&quot;code&quot;&gt;
&amp;lt;VirtualHost *:80&amp;gt;
  ServerName www.chrisroos.co.uk
  ServerAlias chrisroos.co.uk
  RewriteEngine On
  RewriteRule (.*) http://localhost:4010$1 [P]
&amp;lt;/VirtualHost&amp;gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Feel free to go run this on your own server if you&amp;#8217;re so inclined.  At the moment you&amp;#8217;ll have to generate the redirection rules by hand.  In irb, you can do something like:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class=&quot;code ruby&quot;&gt;
# require &#39;yaml&#39;
# # For www.example.com
# rules = { &#39;www.example.com&#39; =&amp;gt; &#39;example.com&#39; }
# File.open(&#39;PATH_TO_RULES_FOLDER&#39; + &#39;/www.example.com&#39;, &#39;w&#39;) { |file| file.puts(rules.to_yaml) }
# # For example.com
# rules = { &#39;/google&#39; =&amp;gt; &#39;www.google.com&#39; }
# File.open(&#39;PATH_TO_RULES_FOLDER&#39; + &#39;/example.com&#39;, &#39;w&#39;) { |file| file.puts(rules.to_yaml) }
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Start the redirection server.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class=&quot;code shell&quot;&gt;
$ REDIRECTION_PORT=XXXX ruby mongrel-redir.rb &amp;amp;
$# Leaving out REDIRECTION_PORT will mean that the server starts on port 4000
$# Leaving out the final ampersand (&amp;amp;) will mean that server runs in the foreground
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Visit www.example.com/google&lt;sup class=&quot;footnote&quot; id=&quot;fnr1&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn1&quot;&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; and watch&lt;sup class=&quot;footnote&quot; id=&quot;fnr2&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn2&quot;&gt;2&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; as you&amp;#8217;re redirected first to example.com/google and then onto www.google.com.  Cool huh.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lots to do &amp;#8211; notably a user interface for managing rules but it&amp;#8217;s not a bad start.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Oh, and this is specifically so that you can redirect from your own domain.  If you don&amp;#8217;t care about the domain then you could try &lt;a href=&quot;http://tinyurl.com&quot;&gt;tinyurl&lt;/a&gt; or, for human friendly URLs, &lt;a href=&quot;http://decenturl.com&quot;&gt;decent url&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;footnote&quot; id=&quot;fn1&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fnr1&quot;&gt;&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/a&gt; Assuming, of course, that www.example.com and example.com both point to the server that this redirection server is running on.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;footnote&quot; id=&quot;fn2&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fnr2&quot;&gt;&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/a&gt; You probably won&amp;#8217;t be able to watch as it&amp;#8217;ll redirect too quickly in the browser &amp;#8211; your best bet is to use &lt;a href=&quot;http://curl.haxx.se/&quot;&gt;curl&lt;/a&gt; or the &lt;a href=&quot;http://livehttpheaders.mozdev.org/&quot;&gt;Live &lt;span class=&quot;caps&quot;&gt;HTTP&lt;/span&gt; Headers&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.mozilla.com/en-US/firefox/&quot;&gt;firefox&lt;/a&gt; extension so see what&amp;#8217;s actually going on.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

        <title>Ruby Rake - Invoke vs Execute</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;First up &amp;#8211; I don&amp;#8217;t know an awful lot about the magic that is &lt;a href=&quot;http://rake.rubyforge.org/&quot;&gt;Rake&lt;/a&gt;.  As such, this is probably common knowledge to most people.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I discovered the difference when trying to execute the db:migrate task from within another rake task (I already knew it worked when declared as a dependency).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class=&quot;code ruby&quot;&gt;
# Rakefile
task :foo do
  Rake::Task[&#39;db:migrate&#39;].execute
end

#$ rake foo
#=&amp;gt; rake aborted!
#=&amp;gt; uninitialized constant ActiveRecord
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I changed &lt;a href=&quot;http://rake.rubyforge.org/classes/Rake/Task.html#M000100&quot;&gt;Task#execute&lt;/a&gt; to &lt;a href=&quot;http://rake.rubyforge.org/classes/Rake/Task.html#M000098&quot;&gt;Task#invoke&lt;/a&gt; and, voila, it all worked fine.  The rdoc for those methods is actually pretty self explanatory, having seen the differences in action.  Oh well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I put together a simple example to demonstrate the differences.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class=&quot;code ruby&quot;&gt;
# The task (task_1) and its dependency (to_be_run_before_task_1)

task :to_be_run_before_task_1 do
  puts &quot;to_be_run_before_task_1&quot;
end

task :task_1 =&amp;gt; [&#39;to_be_run_before_task_1&#39;] do
  puts &quot;task_1&quot;
end

# Three tasks that &#39;run&#39; task_1

task :invoke_task_1 do
  Rake::Task[&#39;task_1&#39;].invoke
end

task :execute_task_1 do
  Rake::Task[&#39;task_1&#39;].execute
end

task :run_task_1_using_dependencies =&amp;gt; [&#39;task_1&#39;]

# &#39;Running&#39; the tasks

#$ rake task_1
#=&amp;gt; to_be_run_before_task_1
#=&amp;gt; task_1

#$ rake invoke_task_1
#=&amp;gt; to_be_run_before_task_1
#=&amp;gt; task_1

#$ rake execute_task_1
#=&amp;gt; task_1 #*** Note that the dependencies are not run

#$ rake run_task_1_using_dependencies
#=&amp;gt; to_be_run_before_task_1
#=&amp;gt; task_1
&lt;/pre&gt;</description>

        <title>Fun with Selenium</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://interblah.net/&quot;&gt;James&lt;/a&gt; and I spent a frustrating, but rewarding, day last Tuesday trying to fix what, for at least four hours, seemed to be a non-reproducible error.  &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.reevoo.com&quot;&gt;We&amp;#8217;ve&lt;/a&gt; used &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.openqa.org/selenium/&quot;&gt;selenium&lt;/a&gt; for a while to test that our reevoomark application is working as expected.  Every so often, some of these reevoomark tests would fail, with either of the following two messages:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class=&quot;code&quot;&gt;
Message: SeleniumCommandError: Timed out after 30000ms
Message: SeleniumCommandError: ERROR: Element xpath=//iframe/ not found
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To my knowledge it was never possible to get these tests to fail on any machine apart from our &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Continuous_Integration&quot;&gt;continuous integration&lt;/a&gt; box.  And even then the failures were intermittent.  Because these failures were so intermittent no-one had invested any real time in trying to find their cause.  Tuesday seemed a bit different though: the tests were failing almost all the time and we decided to do something about it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#8217;ll leave out all of the dead-ends we found and, instead, home-in on the patterns we started to see that led to the eventual resolution.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One of the reevoomarks we offer opens the reviews up in a &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lightbox_%28JavaScript%29&quot;&gt;lightbox&lt;/a&gt;.  However, if the screen isn&amp;#8217;t quite large enough for our content we open it in a standard pop-up window instead.  I&amp;#8217;ll pop an example reevoomark at the bottom of this post so you can see exactly what I mean (you&amp;#8217;ll obviously have to resize your browser to see the effect).  We noticed that our tests would fail when another copy of firefox was already open on our continuous integration box.  Toggling this on and off gave us some confidence that this was, at least one of, the causes of the failures.  We were still unable to reproduce this locally though.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It was around this time that James noticed that we were seeing a pop-up window more than we should have been, i.e. we were seeing a pop-up window when we were expecting to see a lightbox.  This discovery made me happy as up until this stage I&amp;#8217;d been blaming selenium for throwing out useless error messages.  In actual fact selenium was reporting the errors correctly: it really couldn&amp;#8217;t find the element we were looking for (the iframe in the error above) and was therefore timing out.  OK, so if the pop-up was showing in place of the lightbox then it meant that the browser window couldn&amp;#8217;t be big enough for the lightbox.  Yet we explicitly resize the browser in our test to ensure that the lightbox will fit.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class=&quot;code javascript&quot;&gt;
get_eval(&quot;this.browserbot.getCurrentWindow().resizeTo(800,800)&quot;)
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We used the one and only javascript debugging technique (&lt;code&gt;alert(msg)&lt;/code&gt;) to determine that the window was indeed too small for our lightbox.  But hang on, if there wasn&amp;#8217;t another Firefox instance open then the browser &lt;strong&gt;was&lt;/strong&gt; big enough.  So somehow, the presence of another Firefox browser was affecting the maximum size that we could resize our browser to.  It turns out it&amp;#8217;s all to do with the maximum height that Firefox thinks it can expand to.  On a Mac with a hidden dock (or with the dock positioned to the side) the maximum height will be from the status bar at the top of the screen to the bottom of the screen.  With a dock visible at the bottom of the screen the maximum height will be from the status bar at the top of the screen to the top of the dock.  It&amp;#8217;s not quite this simple though: Firefox appears to look at the height of the oldest open firefox window to make its decision too.  Although we had the dock at the bottom of the screen our tests were actually passing on some occasions.  This was due to selenium opening its browser at almost full screen, allowing subsequent windows to be resized to these same dimensions which happen to be plenty big enough for our lightbox.  If we already had another firefox instance open (which by default would open at a maximum height of status bar to top of dock) then our selenium browser could only resize to this height, which wasn&amp;#8217;t big enough for our lightbox to appear.  Phew.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, the result of this entire day&amp;#8217;s work?  Moving the dock to the right hand side of the screen.  Excellent.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Sample lightbox reevoomark&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;script type=&quot;text/javascript&quot; charset=&quot;utf-8&quot;&gt;
  rvo_format=&#39;image_horizontal250x40&#39;;
  rvo_product_id=&#39;1&#39;
  rvo_retailer_ref=&#39;rev&#39;;
  rvo_version = 2;
&lt;/script&gt;

        <title>Short, Human Friendly, Permalinks</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;I was recently asked for my Amazon wishlist.  I wasn&amp;#8217;t able to use email and was expected to write down the &lt;span class=&quot;caps&quot;&gt;URL&lt;/span&gt;.  I had a look and found that the &lt;span class=&quot;caps&quot;&gt;URL&lt;/span&gt; (&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.amazon.co.uk/gp/registry/IO9HVNCPEWGD&quot;&gt;http://www.amazon.co.uk/gp/registry/IO9HVNCPEWGD&lt;/a&gt;) wasn&amp;#8217;t paper or speech friendly.  Instead of attempting to convey this &lt;span class=&quot;caps&quot;&gt;URL&lt;/span&gt;, I used the opportunity to create my own human friendly permalink for my wishlist (&lt;a href=&quot;http://chrisroos.co.uk/amazonwishlist&quot;&gt;chrisroos.co.uk/amazonwishlist&lt;/a&gt;).  I actually started with a hyphenated variant (amazon-wishlist) but realised that the non-hyphenated version would be easier for someone to understand in conversation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This seems to tie in with what &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.scripting.com&quot;&gt;Dave Winer&lt;/a&gt; has been talking about &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.scripting.com/stories/2007/11/20/solvingTheTinyurlCentraliz.html&quot;&gt;recently&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I think this&amp;#8217;d be quite a neat, and fairly easy, little webapp to build.  It would need a simple interface for managing permalinks and the ability to work with multiple domains.  Hmm, I&amp;#8217;m tempted to give this a shot unless anyone knows of anything similar already out there?&lt;/p&gt;</description>

        <title>VRM vs Affiliate Marketing</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;I just read &lt;a href=&quot;http://blogs.law.harvard.edu/vrm/2007/11/16/can-vrm-fix-drm/&quot;&gt;this&lt;/a&gt; article over on the &lt;a href=&quot;http://blogs.law.harvard.edu/vrm/&quot;&gt;Project &lt;span class=&quot;caps&quot;&gt;VRM&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt; blog.  There was a fragment of a sentence that really resonated with me &amp;#8211; highlighted in the quote below.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For copyrighted works, &lt;span class=&quot;caps&quot;&gt;VRM&lt;/span&gt; could involve agreements made on an individual basis ‚Äî ones that could involve actual relationships between copyright holders and their customers. For example, if I buy an open (non-DRM‚Äôd) copy of an album by Mike Marshall (my favorite mandolin player), it might involve letting him know who I am, the fact that I like his work, a commitment not to duplicate it beyond fair uses, and the option to do any number of things, &lt;strong&gt;including re-distributing it for pay that would get us both a slice of the take&lt;/strong&gt;. The options are wide open. What matters is that there would means for a real reslationship based on mutual interest, trust and control.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If I like something enough to want to recommend it to people why shouldn&amp;#8217;t I take a small amount of money from any resulting transaction?  If I was to become an &lt;a href=&quot;http://affiliate-program.amazon.co.uk/gp/associates/join/&quot;&gt;Amazon affiliate&lt;/a&gt; I could already get paid for recommending this album: except that I&amp;#8217;d actually be getting paid for recommending this album &lt;strong&gt;at&lt;/strong&gt; Amazon.  That just makes me feel a little less comfortable than if I was able to get paid for recommending the artist alone.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Having spent about 30 minutes writing and re-writing to come up with that &lt;strong&gt;one&lt;/strong&gt; paragraph above I&amp;#8217;ve realised that I can&amp;#8217;t quite put my finger on why I find the idea so powerful.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Maybe one of the things I like is the decentralisation that the model would imply.  Rather than having one large distributor (Amazon) you have lots of smaller distributors (fans of Mike Marshall&amp;#8217;s music).  Hmm, food for thought.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

        <title>Wow.  Google must really love Chris.</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#8217;d read &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.scripting.com/stories/2007/07/17/instantIndexing.html&quot;&gt;previously&lt;/a&gt; about &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.google.com&quot;&gt;Google&lt;/a&gt; indexing pages in almost real-time.  I only experienced it myself for the first time this evening.  I was continuing to search for answers to my &lt;a href=&quot;/blog/2007-11-20-can-anyone-recommend-a-good-simple-web-hosting-solution&quot;&gt;recent question&lt;/a&gt; when my own question popped up at number three in the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.google.co.uk/search?hl=en&amp;amp;q=static+simple+web+hosting&quot;&gt;search results&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://flickr.com/photos/chrisjroos/2050547123/&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2310/2050547123_31a16714ec.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I assume this might be to do with Google&amp;#8217;s &lt;a href=&quot;http://googlewebmastercentral.blogspot.com/2007/05/taking-advantage-of-universal-search.html&quot;&gt;Universal Search&lt;/a&gt; that blends lots of different sources into their main search results.  Or, they really do just love me.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

        <title>Can anyone recommend a good simple web hosting solution?</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#8217;m keen to move some domains over to &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.google.com/a&quot;&gt;google apps&lt;/a&gt; but I need more than the included Page Creator.  Ideally, I want a very basic, reliable webhost that allows me to host static files.  Anyone have any recommendations?&lt;/p&gt;</description>

        <title>The Skypephone so far</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;I bought the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.skype.com/intl/en/allfeatures/3skypephone/&quot;&gt;Skypephone&lt;/a&gt; from &lt;a href=&quot;http://three.co.uk&quot;&gt;three&lt;/a&gt; about a week ago.  I haven&amp;#8217;t managed to get my number transfered yet and as such I haven&amp;#8217;t really used it in anger, but thought I&amp;#8217;d write some random notes anyway.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I didn&amp;#8217;t get off too a good start with &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.skype.com&quot;&gt;Skype&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;http://3skypephone.com/forum/viewtopic.php?t=154&quot;&gt;not working&lt;/a&gt; on the phone for two or three days after purchase.  Although Skype now works fine, it doesn&amp;#8217;t seem to remember my password, which makes it a bit of a pain each time you want to log in.  I&amp;#8217;ve used skype for text chatting but haven&amp;#8217;t actually used it for voice yet so can&amp;#8217;t comment on the quality.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The phone is an &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.amoi.com&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;caps&quot;&gt;AMOI&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt; (I&amp;#8217;m not 100% sure that&amp;#8217;s the correct site as this phone doesn&amp;#8217;t appear there) WP-S1.  It feels remarkably similar to &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.nokia.com&quot;&gt;Nokia&lt;/a&gt; phones I&amp;#8217;ve used in the past.  In fact, the only difference I&amp;#8217;ve found so far is the keys you press to lock the keypad (star then top-left button, rather than top-left button then start).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you try to visit a website beginning with www then a popup appears telling you that you&amp;#8217;ll be charged for data used.  If you visit a website that doesn&amp;#8217;t start www (e.g. &lt;a href=&quot;http://m.twitter.com&quot;&gt;m.twitter.com&lt;/a&gt;) then you don&amp;#8217;t get this message.  This made me wonder whether I was still being charged for the data I was using &amp;#8211; I guess I must be, right?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#8217;ve connected the phone to my computer successfully using bluetooth and used it to transfer some &lt;a href=&quot;http://flickr.com/photos/chrisjroos/sets/72157603224666780/&quot;&gt;photos&lt;/a&gt; I took yesterday with the 2 megapixel camera.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I think I should be able to use the phone as a modem but the supplied CD contains Windows only software.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hmm, that&amp;#8217;s about all for now I think.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

        <title>NewNet and BT Broadband problems</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#8217;ve been having broadband problems for about 6 weeks now.  My connection continually drops in and out and when it does connect, it does so at about 100Kbps.  I held off getting a &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.bt.com&quot;&gt;BT&lt;/a&gt; engineer involved because I didn&amp;#8217;t want to have to pay the ¬£200 if it turned out to be my fault.  Having satisfied myself that I hadn&amp;#8217;t done anything stoopid, I called &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.newnet.co.uk/&quot;&gt;NewNet&lt;/a&gt; and arranged for the BT engineer to come round this morning.  He was able to confirm that my line was capable of connecting at around 5Mbps (I&amp;#8217;m on the upto 8Mbps service) but noticed that there was a high &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Signal-to-noise_ratio&quot;&gt;Signal to Noise&lt;/a&gt; ratio on the line (around 19dB I think).  He mentioned that the &lt;span class=&quot;caps&quot;&gt;SNR&lt;/span&gt; should be around 10dB and that this might be the cause of my connectivity problems.  He then went to the local junction box to test the line between my house and the junction box and the junction box and the exchange.  The line between the house and the junction box was OK but he changed the line between the junction box and the exchange to rule out any problems at that end.  Even with these changes, he was still seeing a high &lt;span class=&quot;caps&quot;&gt;SNR&lt;/span&gt;.  He then mentioned that he&amp;#8217;d spoken to the helpdesk and they informed him that my line had been limited at 135Kbps.  This explained the poor performance once I was actually connected.  It also explains (I think) why I would see downstream connections of around 5Mbps in my router status but only actually download at around 100Kbps according to the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.thinkbroadband.com/&quot;&gt;thinkbroadband&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.thinkbroadband.com/speedtest.html&quot;&gt;speedtest&lt;/a&gt;.  I guess that my &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.netgear.co.uk/wireless_adslrouter_dg834g.php&quot;&gt;Netgear DG834G&lt;/a&gt; actually reports the potential line speed rather than the actual speed of the connection.  In theory, the fact that my line is limited should sort itself out but I&amp;#8217;ve been informed to call NewNet if it&amp;#8217;s no better within the next couple of days.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Fun and games eh.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

        <title>HSBC Conclusion</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;I finally received a reply from &lt;span class=&quot;caps&quot;&gt;HSBC&lt;/span&gt; to my constant nagging about a possible bug in their Internet Banking software.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our reference : 5629320&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dear Mr Roos&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thank you for your e-mail.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As previously advised, this has been fed back to our Development Team however, we do not offer technical support for any financial packages.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our Internet Banking terms and conditions state that&lt;br /&gt;
we will not be held responsible for any financial management software which you choose to use in connection with the Internet Banking service.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Please be assured that all customer feedback is taken seriously, however we do receive many change requests for our electronic banking services every day.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Each request is recorded to enable us to monitor the number received, these are then assessed for suitability and prioritised accordingly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Although your suggestion cannot be implemented immediately it will be held on our database.  We do advise our customers, via an online message, when upgrades have been made to our electronic banking services.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I trust that this matter is now closed but would like to thank you for bringing this to our attention.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So I replied in order to explain my persistence.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hey,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I appreciate you getting back to me.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To start with, although this causes me some problems, it&amp;#8217;s not big deal.  The reason for my originally getting in touch was that I thought I might be able to help you guys.  I found what I believed to be a bug in your &lt;span class=&quot;caps&quot;&gt;OFX&lt;/span&gt; export and thought that by reporting it with some fairly relevant context (i.e. the section of the &lt;span class=&quot;caps&quot;&gt;OFX&lt;/span&gt; spec that explains what the &lt;span class=&quot;caps&quot;&gt;OFX&lt;/span&gt; export should look like) that it might help you to get it prioritised.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Your response of &amp;#8220;we do not offer technical support for any financial packages&amp;#8221; makes me think that you&amp;#8217;re trying to shrug me off (I appreciate that this may not be the case).  You don&amp;#8217;t need to offer support for financial packages but I would expect that when you boast of downloads in &lt;span class=&quot;caps&quot;&gt;OFX&lt;/span&gt; format that they would actually follow the specification.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I don&amp;#8217;t know whether my approach is the normal approach people would take when reporting problems but I come from an open-source background where people generally help each other out.  Actually, out of interest, how do you &amp;#8220;receive many change requests for our electronic banking services every day&amp;#8221;?  Do other people submit their problems in the same way or was there a more obvious route that I missed?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I guess I feel a little unsatisfied.  Because of the problems I&amp;#8217;ve had getting in contact with anyone from the beginning I find myself not necessarily believing what you are telling me.  However, I do accept that this might not be fair and that you have indeed logged my bug report into your database.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Feel completely free to ignore this suggestion but&amp;#8230;  I think you would get a lot of unexpected benefits by making it easier to give feedback about your Internet Banking site.  I can&amp;#8217;t believe that it&amp;#8217;s just me that feels compelled to help out when they see a problem &amp;#8211; I think you&amp;#8217;d get an awful lot of useful feedback from others too.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Anyway, I guess that&amp;#8217;s it for now.  If there&amp;#8217;s anything I can possibly help with then drop me an email &amp;#8211; I&amp;#8217;ll help out where I can.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#8217;m going to post this letter to my blog too&lt;sup class=&quot;footnote&quot; id=&quot;fnr1&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn1&quot;&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Cheers,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Chris&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;sup class=&quot;footnote&quot; id=&quot;fnr1&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn1&quot;&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; http://blog.seagul.co.uk&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#8217;m sure that at some point in the future, &lt;span class=&quot;caps&quot;&gt;HSBC&lt;/span&gt; will hire some consultants.  Those consultants will tell &lt;span class=&quot;caps&quot;&gt;HSBC&lt;/span&gt; how to utilise the open source community to make the world a better place.  &lt;span class=&quot;caps&quot;&gt;HSBC&lt;/span&gt; will listen because any advice you pay for has to be true&amp;#8230;. Right?&lt;/p&gt;</description>

        <title>Naughty spammy Tesco Entertainment</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;Are Tesco Entertainment the new &lt;a href=&quot;/blog/2007-03-16-orange-orange-orange&quot;&gt;Orange&lt;/a&gt;?  They might just be you know.  See, I&amp;#8217;ve been sad and pathetic enough to &lt;a href=&quot;http://chrisjroos.stikipad.com/unsubscriptions&quot;&gt;record&lt;/a&gt; details of unwanted emails that I receive.  So far &lt;a href=&quot;http://chrisjroos.stikipad.com/unsubscriptions/show/tesco-entertainment&quot;&gt;Tesco Entertainment&lt;/a&gt;, bless &amp;#8216;em, have been unable to remove me from their mailing list for 90 days.  I thought I&amp;#8217;d write them a little email to, you know, ask them to stop spamming me.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here&amp;#8217;s a list of emails you&amp;#8217;ve sent me.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Received: 26-Jun-2007&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Received: 11-Jul-2007&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Received: 27-Jul-2007&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Unsubscribed&lt;/strong&gt;: 30-Jul-2007 (although it appeared that I wasn‚Äôt actually signed up to any offers‚Ä¶)&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Received: 08-Aug-2007&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Received: 21-Aug-2007&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Received: 16-Oct-2007&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;I emailed you on 17th Oct:&lt;br /&gt;
‚ÄúI unsubscribed from you guys on the 30th July 2007 (interestingly, my preferences suggested that I wasn‚Äôt actually subscribed to any mailings in the first place). Since then, you‚Äôve sent me Tesco Entertainment emails on the 8th Aug, 21st Aug and 16th Oct1. Please stop.  Cheers,  Chris  &lt;sup class=&quot;footnote&quot; id=&quot;fnr1&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn1&quot;&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; http://chrisjroos.stikipad.com/unsubscriptions/show/tesco-entertainment‚Äù&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Received: 30-Oct-2007&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You&amp;#8217;ll notice that I&amp;#8217;ve received four emails since unsubscribing on the 30th July.  I think three months is long enough to remove someone from your spam list isn&amp;#8217;t it?  Oh, and you&amp;#8217;ll also see I&amp;#8217;ve emailed you in the past too.  It wouldn&amp;#8217;t hurt to reply would it?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Cheers,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Chris&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Update Thu 15th Nov 2007&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I received a reply from Tesco.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thank you for your email.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#8217;m sorry that you&amp;#8217;ve received some unwanted emails.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#8217;ve made arrangements to remove your email address chris@seagul.co.uk from our database. This process takes about 14 days and during this period you could still get emails from us.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you have any other email addresses registered, please let us know and we can remove these also.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thank you for telling us about this and giving us the chance to put things right.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you have any further queries please do not hesitate to contact us at customer.service@tesco.co.uk quoting TES4278070X.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This phrase made me smile, &amp;#8220;Thank you for telling us about this and giving us the chance to put things right.&amp;#8221;.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

        <title>A common pattern in retailers' receipt pages (and a microformat solution)</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;We&amp;#8217;ve been looking at embedding a little bit of javascript in one of our partner&amp;#8217;s receipt pages to send us the details of which products were purchased (using &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stock_Keeping_Unit&quot;&gt;SKUs&lt;/a&gt;).  A quick glance over the page revealed that nine other providers (&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.google.com/analytics/&quot;&gt;GA&lt;/a&gt;, an &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Search_engine_optimization&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;caps&quot;&gt;SEO&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt; helper and a bunch of price comparators) had the same idea.  That&amp;#8217;s the same data repeated nine times.  Ten if you include the human readable copy.  Now that seems like a problem waiting to be solved to me.  It also feels like a perfect fit for &lt;a href=&quot;http://microformats.org/&quot;&gt;microformats&lt;/a&gt;.  If we had a &lt;a href=&quot;http://microformats.org/wiki/receipt&quot;&gt;receipt microformat&lt;/a&gt; then we could use javascript to parse the data rather than having to re-define it each time.  We would also be removing all duplication and creating semantically rich content (I guess that&amp;#8217;s basically what microformats do anyway) in the process.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, something that might currently look like this:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class=&quot;code html&quot;&gt;
&amp;lt;table&amp;gt;
  &amp;lt;tr&amp;gt;
    &amp;lt;th&amp;gt;Order Number&amp;lt;/th&amp;gt;
    &amp;lt;th&amp;gt;Price&amp;lt;/th&amp;gt;
  &amp;lt;/tr&amp;gt;
  &amp;lt;tr&amp;gt;
    &amp;lt;td&amp;gt;1&amp;lt;/td&amp;gt;
    &amp;lt;td&amp;gt;¬£19.99&amp;lt;/td&amp;gt;
  &amp;lt;/tr&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;/table&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;script type=&quot;text/javascript&quot; charset=&quot;utf-8&quot;&amp;gt;
  var order_id = 1
  var price = 1999
&amp;lt;/script&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;script src=&quot;http://MY-PRICE-COMPARATOR&quot; type=&quot;text/javascript&quot; charset=&quot;utf-8&quot;&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/script&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;script type=&quot;text/javascript&quot; charset=&quot;utf-8&quot;&amp;gt;
  var orderNumber = 1
  var price = 19.99
&amp;lt;/script&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;script src=&quot;http://MY-SEO-HELPER&quot; type=&quot;text/javascript&quot; charset=&quot;utf-8&quot;&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/script&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;!-- And repeat... --&amp;gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Could become much simpler:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class=&quot;code html&quot;&gt;
&amp;lt;table&amp;gt;
  &amp;lt;tr&amp;gt;
    &amp;lt;th&amp;gt;Order Number&amp;lt;/th&amp;gt;
    &amp;lt;th&amp;gt;Price&amp;lt;/th&amp;gt;
  &amp;lt;/tr&amp;gt;
  &amp;lt;tr&amp;gt;
    &amp;lt;td class=&quot;orderNumber&quot;&amp;gt;1&amp;lt;/td&amp;gt;
    &amp;lt;td class=&quot;orderPrice&quot;&amp;gt;&amp;lt;span class=&quot;orderCurrency&quot;&amp;gt;¬£&amp;lt;/span&amp;gt;19.99&amp;lt;/td&amp;gt;
  &amp;lt;/tr&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;/table&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;script src=&quot;http://MY-PRICE-COMPARATOR&quot; type=&quot;text/javascript&quot; charset=&quot;utf-8&quot;&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/script&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;script src=&quot;http://MY-SEO-HELPER&quot; type=&quot;text/javascript&quot; charset=&quot;utf-8&quot;&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/script&amp;gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There has been discussion of such a &lt;a href=&quot;http://microformats.org/wiki/receipt&quot;&gt;receipt microformat&lt;/a&gt; but a quick search seemed to suggest that it hasn&amp;#8217;t been discussed in the context of this specific problem.  Maybe I&amp;#8217;ll go add my voice to that discussion&amp;#8230;&lt;/p&gt;</description>

        <title>More Hsbc Shenanigans</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;This will be of interest to very few (if any) people &amp;#8211; I&amp;#8217;d suggest you just move on to something more interesting.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yesterday, I contacted Hsbc using the Internet Banking feedback form that was outside of the Internet Banking site itself.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I believe that the Ofx export of transactions has been broken since your internet banking &amp;#8216;upgrade&amp;#8217;.  I&amp;#8217;ve tried many times to contact you using My Messages and also over the phone &amp;#8211; the people I seem to be dealing with are unable or unwilling to help.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#8217;s a very minor problem &amp;#8211; my account is overdrawn yet the balance is shown as positive in the Ofx export.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#8217;ve posted about the issue on my blog&lt;sup class=&quot;footnote&quot; id=&quot;fnr1&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn1&quot;&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;, in the hope that someone might provide me some contact details of someone that can actually help.  Unfortunately that didn&amp;#8217;t get my anywhere.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I look forward to hearing from you.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Cheers,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Chris&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;sup class=&quot;footnote&quot; id=&quot;fnr1&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn1&quot;&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; http://blog.seagul.co.uk/articles/2007/10/05/trying-to-speak-to-someone-in-development-at-hsbc-can-anyone-help&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I was hoping to get through to a human.  Unfortunately I just got the same copy and paste bot that I get from within the Internet banking site.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dear Mr Roos&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our Reference: 508-5629320-15102007-RR&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thank you for using the feedback facility for our Internet Banking service.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is with regard to your recent e-mail concerning problems related to the download of transactions. From our experience to date, we have found that similar queries have been most effectively dealt with over the telephone rather than an exchange of a series of e-mails.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On occasions it can be of benefit to be online whilst talking to us. You may wish to call from a separate line to your Internet connection.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you require further assistance, please call us on 0845 600 2290 (within UK) or +44 1226261226 (outside UK).  Minicom support is available on 0845 7125563.  The Internet Banking Helpdesk is open from Monday to Sunday 8.00am to 10.00pm (UK times).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Kind Regards&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Rajan&lt;br /&gt;
Technical Support Representative&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;caps&quot;&gt;HSBC&lt;/span&gt; Internet Banking Technical Support&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tonight, I&amp;#8217;ve emailed their complaints email address.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hi,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#8217;ll apologise in advance for potentially mis-using your complaints email address.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#8217;ve got a problem with downloading my transactions in Ofx format from the Internet banking site.  I&amp;#8217;ve written up my experience so far&lt;sup class=&quot;footnote&quot; id=&quot;fnr1&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn1&quot;&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;.  As a web developer with experience of the Ofx format I&amp;#8217;m fairly sure that you&amp;#8217;ve got a bug in your Internet banking site.  I&amp;#8217;ve been trying for over a month to speak to someone in your support department to no avail.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All I want is for you (or someone that is able to do more than hit copy, paste, send) to read the post below and pass this information on to your development team &amp;#8211; they will be able to help.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Be assured that I&amp;#8217;m really just trying to help you guys.  If you need anything else from me then just give me a shout.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Cheers,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Chris&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#8217;m getting slightly concerned that I might be wrong now &amp;#8211; then I&amp;#8217;d look real stoopid.  As it is I just look a bit sad.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

        <title>Trying to speak to someone in development at Hsbc - can anyone help?</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#8217;m almost 100% certain that there&amp;#8217;s a &lt;a href=&quot;http://twitter.com/chrisroos/statuses/247143372&quot;&gt;bug&lt;/a&gt; in the Hsbc Internet Banking site.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My account is overdrawn yet the balance shows as positive when I download my transactions in either &amp;#8216;Money 98 onwards (ofx)&amp;#8217; or &amp;#8216;Quicken 2002 (ofx)&amp;#8217;.  I believe that section 3.2.9.2 of the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.ofx.net&quot;&gt;Ofx&lt;/a&gt; 2.1.1 spec explains that these balances should be shown as negative.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#8217;ve tried to &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.flickr.com/search/?w=31365693@N00&amp;amp;q=hsbc+AND+ofx&amp;amp;m=tags&quot;&gt;email&lt;/a&gt; and I&amp;#8217;ve &lt;a href=&quot;http://twitter.com/chrisroos/statuses/279942352&quot;&gt;tried&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;http://twitter.com/chrisroos/statuses/279956472&quot;&gt;to&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;http://twitter.com/chrisroos/statuses/313632312&quot;&gt;call&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;http://twitter.com/chrisroos/statuses/313656682&quot;&gt;hsbc&lt;/a&gt;.  Both to no avail.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Does anyone know anyone that works at Hsbc and might be able to get a message to someone in development?  If not, what&amp;#8217;s the etiquette on facebook groups?  I notice that there a few hsbc groups &amp;#8211; can I just post messages to them asking for help?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#8217;ve gotten so used to dealing with &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.wesabe.com&quot;&gt;real&lt;/a&gt; companies that I&amp;#8217;d forgotten how the old world works.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

        <title>A microformat for my contact details (instant messaging, twitter et al)</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;I haven&amp;#8217;t done any research on this so it may have already been proposed over at the &lt;a href=&quot;http://microformats.org/&quot;&gt;microformats&lt;/a&gt; site.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;The problem&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sometimes I want to communicate with the author of a webpage.  I don&amp;#8217;t want to have to hunt around to find contact details and I probably don&amp;#8217;t want to fill in a form.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;A proposal to fix part of the problem&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If the author&amp;#8217;s contact details were semantically marked up, either on the page I was looking at or linked to elsewhere on the web, then I could use a simple parser to extract those details and select the best communication tool to use manually.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Maybe some code can help explain what I mean.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;A semantically marked up contact page.&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;pre class=&quot;code html&quot;&gt;
&amp;lt;!DOCTYPE html PUBLIC &quot;-//W3C//DTD HTML 4.01//EN&quot;&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;html&amp;gt;

  &amp;lt;head&amp;gt;
    &amp;lt;title&amp;gt;Contact Details&amp;lt;/title&amp;gt;
  &amp;lt;/head&amp;gt;

  &amp;lt;body&amp;gt;
    &amp;lt;dl class=&quot;contactDetails&quot;&amp;gt;
      &amp;lt;dt&amp;gt;Skype&amp;lt;/dt&amp;gt;
      &amp;lt;dd class=&quot;skype identifier&quot;&amp;gt;skype-username&amp;lt;/dd&amp;gt;
      &amp;lt;dt&amp;gt;MSN&amp;lt;/dt&amp;gt;
      &amp;lt;dd class=&quot;msn identifier&quot;&amp;gt;msn-username&amp;lt;/dd&amp;gt;
    &amp;lt;/dl&amp;gt;
  &amp;lt;/body&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;/html&amp;gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;A parser in &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.ruby-lang.org/&quot;&gt;ruby&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;pre class=&quot;code ruby&quot;&gt;
require &#39;rubygems&#39;
require &#39;hpricot&#39;

class ContactParser
  def self.from_html(html)
    doc = Hpricot(html)
    new(doc)
  end
  def initialize(hpricot_doc)
    @hpricot_doc = hpricot_doc
  end
  def service_identifiers
    (@hpricot_doc/&#39;.contactDetails .identifier&#39;).inject({}) do |hash, e|
       service = (e.classes - [&#39;identifier&#39;]).first
       identifier = e.inner_text
       hash[service] = identifier
       hash
    end
  end
  def identifier(service)
    (@hpricot_doc/&quot;.contactDetails .#{service}.identifier&quot;).inner_text
  end
end

contact_details_file = File.dirname(__FILE__) + &#39;/contact-details.html&#39;
html = File.open(contact_details_file) { |f| f.read }
parser = ContactParser.from_html(html)

p parser.service_identifiers
# =&amp;gt; {&quot;skype&quot;=&amp;gt;&quot;skype-username&quot;, &quot;msn&quot;=&amp;gt;&quot;msn-username&quot;}
p parser.identifier(&#39;skype&#39;)
# =&amp;gt; &#39;skype-username&#39;
p parser.identifier(&#39;blurgh&#39;)
# =&amp;gt; &#39;&#39;
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Further considerations&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;If existing communication tools&lt;sup class=&quot;footnote&quot; id=&quot;fnr1&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn1&quot;&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; were to integrate this parser then it would be easy to add a contact by giving the url of, for example, their blog.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Author&amp;#8217;s should be able to specify the order of the tools that they wish to use for communication.  We could just assume that the list of contact details is in the author&amp;#8217;s preferred order.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;This would be open to spam.  Err, not too sure what to do about this.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Ultimately, I&amp;#8217;d like to hit a &amp;#8216;communicate&amp;#8217; button in &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.mozilla.com/en-US/firefox/&quot;&gt;firefox&lt;/a&gt; that automatically decides which communication protocols we have in common and allows me to get my message through.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Anyone have any thoughts?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Code is all over on &lt;a href=&quot;http://chrisroos.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/contact-microformat/&quot;&gt;google code&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;footnote&quot; id=&quot;fn1&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fnr1&quot;&gt;&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/a&gt; I&amp;#8217;m thinking of multi protocol tools, like &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.adiumx.com/&quot;&gt;adium&lt;/a&gt;, in particular.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

        <title>Finding similar sites by mining the del.icio.us data</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;So this is very much proof of concept and definitely not very useful in its current form&amp;#8230;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You need to execute this javascript in the context of a webpage.  In &lt;a href=&quot;http://getfirebug.com/&quot;&gt;firebug&lt;/a&gt; (for example), paste it into the console and run.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class=&quot;code javascript&quot;&gt;
// Execute this within an existing webpage, using, for example, firebug console
function includeDelicious() {
  function loadScript(scriptUrl) {
    var scriptTag = document.createElement(&#39;script&#39;);
    scriptTag.setAttribute(&#39;type&#39;, &#39;text/javascript&#39;);
    scriptTag.src = scriptUrl;
    document.body.appendChild(scriptTag);
  }
  loadScript(&#39;http://s3.amazonaws.com/seagul/delicious.js&#39;);
}
if (typeof(getRelatedPosts) != &#39;function&#39;) { includeDelicious(); }
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The javascript above loads this &lt;a href=&quot;http://s3.amazonaws.com/seagul/delicious.js&quot;&gt;script&lt;/a&gt; that in turn loads &lt;a href=&quot;http://s3.amazonaws.com/seagul/md5.js&quot;&gt;md5.js&lt;/a&gt;,  &lt;a href=&quot;http://s3.amazonaws.com/seagul/jquery.js&quot;&gt;jquery.js&lt;/a&gt;, does some magic with the &lt;a href=&quot;http://del.icio.us&quot;&gt;del.icio.us&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.json.org&quot;&gt;json&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;http://del.icio.us/help/json/&quot;&gt;feeds&lt;/a&gt; before finally writing some &amp;#8216;similar&amp;#8217; sites to the bottom of the page you&amp;#8217;re currently looking.  At the moment it finds the three most recent sites you&amp;#8217;ve bookmarked for each of the tags that people have used when bookmarking the site you&amp;#8217;re looking at.  It writes all this to the bottom of the current page, as this &lt;a href=&quot;http://flickr.com/photos/chrisjroos/1474875125/&quot;&gt;screenshot&lt;/a&gt; shows.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lots of things to do before this could possibly be deemed useful but I think it&amp;#8217;s got some potential.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

        <title>Commenting on my del.icio.us bookmarks</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;A side effect of my &lt;a href=&quot;http://del.icio.us&quot;&gt;del.icio.us&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;http://del.icio.us/chrisjroos&quot;&gt;bookmarks&lt;/a&gt; having &lt;a href=&quot;/blog/2007-09-05-patching-the-del-icio-us-firefox-extension-to-add-permalinks&quot;&gt;permalinks&lt;/a&gt; is that you can, if you really really want, &amp;#8216;comment&amp;#8217; on them.  You just need to bookmark (in del.icio.us) my permalinked bookmark, write a comment in the notes field and tag it for:chrisjroos.  One small step to people being able to comment on anything they see (just an idea I&amp;#8217;ve had bubbling for a while).&lt;/p&gt;</description>

        <title>Monitoring the Mac OSX Filesystem with ruby</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;On Thursday, &lt;a href=&quot;http://blog.floehopper.org/&quot;&gt;James&lt;/a&gt; and I spent some time investigating remote pairing options.  One tiny part of that investigation was finding a way to keep two remote filesystems in sync.  I initially thought of using &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rsync&quot;&gt;rsync&lt;/a&gt; at regular intervals with &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cron&quot;&gt;cron&lt;/a&gt;.  Unless I&amp;#8217;ve missed something, the smallest interval between cron jobs is one minute which is potentially too long.  We wanted a way to rsync (or sync in general) whenever the filesystem changed.  A little searching brought this &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.kernelthread.com/software/fslogger/&quot;&gt;fslogger&lt;/a&gt; tool to my attention.  It simply writes some event details to &lt;span class=&quot;caps&quot;&gt;STDOUT&lt;/span&gt; every time something changes on the filesystem.  I figured that we could use this, with a little bit of ruby glue, to trigger rsync.  Our glue script continuously reads from &lt;span class=&quot;caps&quot;&gt;STDIN&lt;/span&gt;, tries to match some pre-defined patterns and triggers rsync if those patterns are matched.  It&amp;#8217;s very brittle but it gets the job done.  Well, actually, it only partially gets the job done: I&amp;#8217;m very unfamiliar with rsync but it seemed to take between 10 and 30 seconds to sync even if only one file had changed.  I suspect that I may have been doing something wrong though.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class=&quot;code ruby&quot;&gt;
#!/usr/bin/env ruby

REMOTE_SERVER = &#39;YOUR_REMOTE_SERVER&#39;
REMOTE_PATH = &#39;YOUR_REMOTE_PATH&#39;

DIRECTORY_PATTERN = ARGV.delete_at(0)
raise &quot;You must specify a directory_pattern&quot; unless DIRECTORY_PATTERN

def rsync!
  `rsync -rz #{File.join(DIRECTORY_PATTERN, &#39;*&#39;)} #{REMOTE_SERVER}:#{REMOTE_PATH}`
end

while line=gets
  if line =~ /FSE_ARG_VNODE/ # CREATE FILE OR DIR
    rsync! if line[/path\s+=(.*)/, 1].strip =~ Regexp.new(DIRECTORY_PATTERN)
  elsif line =~ /FSE_ARG_STRING/ # REMOVE FILE OR DIR
    rsync! if line[/string\s+=(.*)/, 1].strip =~ Regexp.new(DIRECTORY_PATTERN)
  end
end
&lt;/pre&gt;</description>

        <title>Why should it do that?</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#8217;ve started looking into my *cough* promise *cough* to do that &lt;a href=&quot;/blog/2007-06-01-an-open-letter-to-my-local-newspapers&quot;&gt;local paper&lt;/a&gt; site I mentioned sometime ago.  The code is all in me &lt;a href=&quot;http://chrisroos.googlecode.com&quot;&gt;google code&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;http://chrisroos.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/the-local-paper/&quot;&gt;repository&lt;/a&gt; if you want to see how it&amp;#8217;s going (or finish it when I inevitably get bored again&amp;#8230;).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Anyway, the point of this post is that I realised something about testing that I feel I may have missed in the past.  I&amp;#8217;ve got used to stating the &lt;a href=&quot;http://behaviour-driven.org/&quot;&gt;behavior&lt;/a&gt; of the objects in my system through tests.  So, when I wanted to ensure that an article couldn&amp;#8217;t be created without a title, I added a test like so:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class=&quot;code ruby&quot;&gt;
class ArticleTest &amp;lt; Test::Unit::TestCase
  def test_should_validate_presence_of_title
    ...
  end
end
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In fact, for an article comprised of a title, an edition, a page number and an author, I wanted to ensure that all were there apart from the author.  It was only once I&amp;#8217;d added tests to &lt;a href=&quot;http://api.rubyonrails.org/classes/ActiveRecord/Validations.html&quot;&gt;validate&lt;/a&gt; the presence of the other three attributes that I realised it was probably important to prove that an author wasn&amp;#8217;t required.  So, I added the relevant test.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class=&quot;code ruby&quot;&gt;
class ArticleTest &amp;lt; Test::Unit::TestCase
  def test_should_not_validate_presence_of_author
    ...
  end
end
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That&amp;#8217;s all well and good, but I&amp;#8217;ve lost some information: &lt;span class=&quot;caps&quot;&gt;WHY&lt;/span&gt; it shouldn&amp;#8217;t validate the presence of an author.  I know at the moment why it shouldn&amp;#8217;t (because short articles don&amp;#8217;t have an author listed), but will I know at some point the future?  I suspect not.  The same obviously applies for the things that I do want to ensure are present.  Why do I care that an article has a title, edition and page number?  At the moment I care because I&amp;#8217;m planning on making them part of the &lt;span class=&quot;caps&quot;&gt;URL&lt;/span&gt;, but what if I decide not to go down that route, yet leave the tests there?  There&amp;#8217;ll be no easy way for someone in the future to determine whether those things are actually important or not.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I wonder if this issue was highlighted because of my lack of &lt;a href=&quot;http://subversion.tigris.org/&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;caps&quot;&gt;SVN&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt; access.  I generally like really small checkins to my &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Revision_control&quot;&gt;version control software&lt;/a&gt; which would&amp;#8217;ve allowed me to have added and committed those validation additions one at a time, and with messages that would have stated the reasons for that change&lt;sup class=&quot;footnote&quot; id=&quot;fnr1&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn1&quot;&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;.  Being disconnected means that I end up with bigger checkins that inevitably lose some information.  Actually, the more I think about it, the more I think that the repository isn&amp;#8217;t the right place for this information anyway &amp;#8211; it&amp;#8217;s too far away from the code that&amp;#8217;s solving the problems.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;How do other people solve this potential loss of knowledge?  Am I missing something obvious, or have I really just not noticed this before?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;P.S. I spent a few minutes chatting with &lt;a href=&quot;http://interblah.net/&quot;&gt;James&lt;/a&gt; about it today and he had some interesting suggestions, although I&amp;#8217;ll leave it up to him to share those if he wants (no pressure James, I&amp;#8217;m just running out of time right now I&amp;#8217;m afraid).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;footnote&quot; id=&quot;fn1&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fnr1&quot;&gt;&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;http://po-ru.com&quot;&gt;Paul&lt;/a&gt; suggested a while back that we use the commit note to explain the problem that we&amp;#8217;ve solved, rather than just describing the changeset.  Unfortunately, I can&amp;#8217;t find the source of that suggestion so no link I&amp;#8217;m afraid.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

        <title>Companies.  You must make it simple for me to unsubscribe from your marketing shite.</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;Over the past few months I&amp;#8217;ve been actively trying to unsubscribe from things that I&amp;#8217;m no longer interested in.  Both electronic and traditional mail.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#8217;ve started to keep a little &lt;a href=&quot;http://chrisjroos.stikipad.com/unsubscriptions/show/HomePage&quot;&gt;record&lt;/a&gt; of when I receive said shite and when I unsubscribe.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Something I&amp;#8217;ve learned over this short time.  The majority of companies make it very easy for you to signup to receive their shite.  It is almost always harder (if only by one step) to unsubscribe from the same material.  Why?  If I&amp;#8217;m trying to unsubscribe it&amp;#8217;s probably because I&amp;#8217;m not interested in what you&amp;#8217;re doing.  Why would you possibly want to make it hard for me to go.  Why not just add a second button to the form that makes it easy for me to subscribe.  This button would say &amp;#8216;unsubscribe&amp;#8217; and would do exactly that.  Easy huh.

        <title>Patching the del.icio.us firefox extension to add permalinks</title>
        <description>&lt;div class=&quot;notice&quot;&gt;28-Apr-2009.  This is now a firefox extension hosted at &lt;a href=&quot;https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/11664&quot;&gt;addons.mozilla.org&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I spent some of my train time today hacking around with the &lt;a href=&quot;http://del.icio.us&quot;&gt;del.icio.us&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.mozilla.com/en-US/firefox/&quot;&gt;firefox&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/3615&quot;&gt;extension&lt;/a&gt;.  Although I&amp;#8217;m sure it&amp;#8217;s bad in many, many ways, I&amp;#8217;ve managed to add the &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Permalink&quot;&gt;permalink&lt;/a&gt; functionality I &lt;a href=&quot;/blog/2007-09-04-permalinks-for-del-icio-us-bookmarks-posts&quot;&gt;mentioned&lt;/a&gt; yesterday.  You can either apply the patch yourself, or download the patched jar file.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;To apply the patch.&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;pre class=&quot;code shell&quot;&gt;
# Install Firefox extension 1.5.43
$ cd MY_FIREFOX_PROFILE_DIRECTORY # ~/Library/Application Support/Firefox/Profiles/RAND_CHARS.default for me
$ cd extensions/{2fa4ed95-0317-4c6a-a74c-5f3e3912c1f9}/chrome
$ svn export http://chrisroos.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/delicious_url_tags/delicious-extension-url-tag.patch
$ unzip deliciousBookmarks.jar
$ rm deliciousBookmarks.jar
$ patch -p1 &amp;lt; delicious-extension-url-tag.patch
$ zip -r deliciousBookmarks.jar content/ locale/ skin/
$ rm -rf content/ locale/ skin/
# Restart Firefox
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;To use the patched compressed file&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;pre class=&quot;code shell&quot;&gt;
# Install Firefox extension 1.5.43
$ cd MY_FIREFOX_PROFILE_DIRECTORY # ~/Library/Application Support/Firefox/Profiles/RAND_CHARS.default for me
$ cd extensions/{2fa4ed95-0317-4c6a-a74c-5f3e3912c1f9}/chrome
$ rm deliciousBookmarks.jar
$ svn export http://chrisroos.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/delicious_url_tags/deliciousBookmarks.jar
# Restart Firefox
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now, anytime you bookmark a site, the tags field will be pre-populated with a url-tag (&amp;#8220;url/MD5_OF_URL&amp;#8221;).  Cool huh.  Oh, and the patched extension uses this javascript &lt;a href=&quot;http://pajhome.org.uk/crypt/md5/&quot;&gt;md5&lt;/a&gt; library.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

        <title>Permalinks for del.icio.us bookmarks (posts)</title>
        <description>&lt;div class=&quot;notice&quot;&gt;28-Apr-2009.  This is now a firefox extension hosted at &lt;a href=&quot;https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/11664&quot;&gt;addons.mozilla.org&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#8217;ve wondered in the &lt;a href=&quot;http://tech.groups.yahoo.com/group/ydn-delicious/message/1447&quot;&gt;past&lt;/a&gt; about sending &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trackback&quot;&gt;trackbacks&lt;/a&gt; (or &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pingback&quot;&gt;pingbacks&lt;/a&gt;) to bookmarked resources on &lt;a href=&quot;http://del.icio.us&quot;&gt;del.icio.us&lt;/a&gt;.  As with most things, you can either wait for someone to do it for you, or you can do it yourself&amp;#8230;  I started to investigate last Thursday afternoon and soon got sucked into the much more interesting issue of the missing &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Permalink&quot;&gt;permalinks&lt;/a&gt; for bookmarks.  You see, every time you bookmark something on del.icio.us, you are creating a new &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Representational_State_Transfer#REST.27s_Central_Principle:_Resources&quot;&gt;resource&lt;/a&gt;.  Unfortunately, it&amp;#8217;s a very sad :-( resource.  Sad because it doesn&amp;#8217;t have a &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.wikipedia.org/wiki/URL&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;caps&quot;&gt;URL&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt; and so can&amp;#8217;t be linked to.  An anonymous resource floating around the world wide web looking for love.  Boo hoo.  Anyway, enough of that.  I figured that if we could assign a unique tag to each of these resources then they would, as a side effect, get a permalink (you can already get your bookmarks containing a given tag by using http://del.icio.us/&lt;span class=&quot;caps&quot;&gt;USERNAME&lt;/span&gt;/MY_TAG).  I experimented with using the url as a tag.  Although there seem to be some limits on what you can use, I found that if you strip the protocol and trailing slash from a url you are generally OK.  So, if we bookmark &lt;a href=&quot;http://news.bbc.co.uk&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;caps&quot;&gt;BBC&lt;/span&gt; News&lt;/a&gt; and tag it with news.bbc.co.uk then we can access that individual bookmark at &lt;a href=&quot;http://del.icio.us/chrisjroos/news.bbc.co.uk&quot;&gt;http://del.icio.us/chrisjroos/news.bbc.co.uk&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://flickr.com/photos/chrisjroos/1293075032/&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://farm2.static.flickr.com/1140/1293075032_372cce286d_m.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As you can only bookmark the same &lt;span class=&quot;caps&quot;&gt;URL&lt;/span&gt; once, it should guarantee that the url-tag is unique.  I can, however, see a problem with the trailing slash.  Although it&amp;#8217;s possible to bookmark URLs that differ only in the trailing slash (http://example.com/article1 and http://example.com/article1/ for example), it doesn&amp;#8217;t seem possible to create a tag that contains that same trailing slash.  OK, so we could always ensure that we remove the trailing slashes from the URLs we bookmark but that doesn&amp;#8217;t seem like a very robust solution.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While experimenting, I found that I could use forward slashes within my tags, www.foo.com/bar/baz for example.  So, I started prepending url/ to my url-tag so that I could easily recognise posts that already had permalinks.  It was at this time that I noticed the similarity between the del.icio.us url history page del.icio.us/url/MD5_OF_URL (e.g. &lt;a href=&quot;http://del.icio.us/url/4961e08b5118fbfddec7fb18fa303151&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;caps&quot;&gt;BBC&lt;/span&gt; News&lt;/a&gt;) and my permalinked bookmark, del.icio.us/chrisjroos/url/&lt;span class=&quot;caps&quot;&gt;URL&lt;/span&gt;.  If I was to &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MD5&quot;&gt;hash&lt;/a&gt; the bookmarked url in the same way as del.icio.us then I would end up with a url like del.icio.us/chrisjroos/url/MD5_OF_URL.  You can see the similarity in the URLs below.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://del.icio.us/chrisjroos/url/4961e08b5118fbfddec7fb18fa303151&quot;&gt;http://del.icio.us/chrisjroos/url/4961e08b5118fbfddec7fb18fa303151&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://del.icio.us/url/4961e08b5118fbfddec7fb18fa303151&quot;&gt;http://del.icio.us/url/4961e08b5118fbfddec7fb18fa303151&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It looks as though it&amp;#8217;s part of del.icio.us itself doesn&amp;#8217;t it?  Cool huh.  It&amp;#8217;d be really cool to extend the del.icio.us &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.mozilla.com/en-US/firefox/&quot;&gt;firefox&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/1532&quot;&gt;extension&lt;/a&gt; to automatically add this tag when bookmarking a site.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#8217;ve created a crappy script that will add this url/MD5_OF_URL tag to each of your posts.  It&amp;#8217;s hosted on &lt;a href=&quot;http://chrisroos.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/delicious_url_tags&quot;&gt;google code&lt;/a&gt; and pasted below.  Err, use at your own risk by the way.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Blue card user stories coming out of the reevoo.com feedback</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;It took me a while, but I&amp;#8217;ve come up with some &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User_story&quot;&gt;stories&lt;/a&gt; to represent the feature requests from the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.reevoo.com&quot;&gt;reevoo.com&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;/blog/2007-08-23-responses-to-reevoo-com-feedback&quot;&gt;feedback&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I (well &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.po-ru.com&quot;&gt;Paul&lt;/a&gt; actually) even took a photo to prove it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://flickr.com/photos/chrisjroos/1284248507&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://farm2.static.flickr.com/1175/1284248507_c7d8653554_m.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We have a &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Extreme_Programming_Practices#Planning_game&quot;&gt;planning game&lt;/a&gt; next Tuesday (4th Sep) so we&amp;#8217;ll have to wait to see if any of them get in.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#8217;ve written the cards out in full below.  If anyone recognises one of their requests and thinks I&amp;#8217;ve misrepresented it then feel free to let me know.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Remove search filters&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As a user of reevoo.com, I want to be able to remove filters in the same way that I can add them, so that I don&amp;#8217;t have to start my search again if I want to change my search criteria.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Display scores of related products&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As a user of reevoo.com, I want to see the scores of &amp;#8216;related products&amp;#8217;, so that I can instantly decide whether those products might be of interest to me.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Display usefulness of reviews&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As a user of reevoo.com, I want to know how useful the reviews are, so that I can get a feel for the &amp;#8216;importance&amp;#8217; of a review.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Favicon&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As a user of reevoo.com, I want to immediately identify your favicon with reevoo branding, so that I can immediately pick it out in my search history and browser tabs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Recently viewed products&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As a user of reevoo.com, I want to see a list of my recently viewed products, so that I can easily find my way back to the products I&amp;#8217;m interested in.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Scores obviously out of 10&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As a user of reevoo.com, I want it to be obvious that the review scores are out of 10, so that I don&amp;#8217;t waste time trying to work it out and can, instead, find the products that I&amp;#8217;m interested in.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Product count on supercategory pages&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As a user of reevoo.com, I always want to see the number of products appear next to the product category, so that I can easily scan down the list of categories.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;General comments&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As a user of reevoo.com, I want to be able to immediately identify that the general comments are indeed general comments, so that I don&amp;#8217;t waste time trying to work out what they are and whether they&amp;#8217;re important.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

        <title>Responses to reevoo.com feedback</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;First of all I&amp;#8217;d like to thank the 18 people that left feedback about the new &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.reevoo.com&quot;&gt;reevoo.com&lt;/a&gt;, either in the comments on my &lt;a href=&quot;/blog/2007-08-01-a-new-reevoo-com&quot;&gt;post&lt;/a&gt; or in replies to emails sent out by various people in the company.  I&amp;#8217;ve tried to collate the feedback (paraphrasing the points) and provide answers to each point in turn.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Moving forward, we&amp;#8217;ve created a public &lt;a href=&quot;http://groups.google.com/group/reevoo-website&quot;&gt;google group&lt;/a&gt; to discuss &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.reevoo.com&quot;&gt;reevoo.com&lt;/a&gt;.  Membership is open to all so feel free to sign-up.  &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.reevoo.com/pages/about_us#Richard&quot;&gt;Richard&lt;/a&gt; has a few reservations about exposing ourselves to the potential problems that an open forum can bring, so this is kinda-like a private invite that the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.techcrunch.com&quot;&gt;techcrunch&lt;/a&gt; crowd love so much.  I really appreciate Richard giving us the freedom to experiment with the group and would love to see people joining up to discuss how we can make reevoo.com a better place.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Anyway, on with the feedback&amp;#8230;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Points raised by four different people&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;I want it to be obvious when you couldn&amp;#8217;t find any products for my search query.  Currently, as no message is displayed, it&amp;#8217;s unclear whether my search didn&amp;#8217;t work or the site is broken.&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This has been fixed and is now live on &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.reevoo.com/search?q=blurgh&quot;&gt;reevoo.com&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;I question whether the google map, on the homepage, is useful.&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hmm, this is obviously a bit subjective.  While four people have questioned its usefulness (including one person that wanted to kill the individual that came up with it &amp;#8211; err, yeah, sorry about that), three people have said that it really helps to understand where the reviews come from.  I&amp;#8217;m open-minded but think we&amp;#8217;ll probably keep it there for now and possibly remove it in the future if the bounce rate (from the homepage) becomes something that we care about.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Points raised by three different people&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;I like the google map.&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yay.  Actually, you should probably see the point above.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;I don&amp;#8217;t always have enough time to read the reviews that flash up as part of the google map.&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Agreed.  Each review is now displayed for 10 seconds, rather than the previous 5.  The development is complete, we&amp;#8217;re just waiting for a deployment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;I find the supercategory pages (linked from the tabs at the top) hard to navigate as the categories on the left of the screen don&amp;#8217;t appear in any useful order.&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The categories are now in alphabetic order.  We also only display the five most popular (as decided by the reevoo gods) categories when you first visit the page, giving you the option to show all if you wish.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;I want to be able to click the review on the homepage to see all reviews of that product.&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I felt quite strongly about this too.  It didn&amp;#8217;t seem right that a product page (with the reviews on) was a minimum of two clicks away from the homepage.  We&amp;#8217;ve fixed this up and it&amp;#8217;s now live.  If any of the reviews that pop-up on the homepage take your fancy then click the name of product (in the review box on the right hand side) to visit that page.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;I want to know what order the products appear in on the search results and category pages.&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They appear in the top-secret reevoo ranking order.  Muhahaha.  Actually, it&amp;#8217;s not that top secret.  It&amp;#8217;s a combination of the review score over time (how &amp;#8216;good&amp;#8217; it is), the number of times people see the reevoomark for that product on our partner sites (how &amp;#8216;popular&amp;#8217; it is) and the number of prices we get from &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.shopping.com&quot;&gt;shopping.com&lt;/a&gt; (how &amp;#8216;current&amp;#8217; it is).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Points raised by two different people&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;I want to understand the relationship between the overall score and the score breakdown for a product.  For example, the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.reevoo.com/reviews/mpn/ericsson/k800i&quot;&gt;Ericsson K800i&lt;/a&gt; is rated 9/10 yet it only scored above average in one category (&amp;#8216;features&amp;#8217;).&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A bit of an explanation is required I feel.  The overall review score you see (9/10 in this instance) is made up of some averaged averages (hmmm, that&amp;#8217;s not too helpful).  OK, so a reviewer will be asked a series of questions about their purchase.  Some of these questions will require text answers, while some will require a score out of ten.  For each review, we calculate the &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mean#Arithmetic_mean&quot;&gt;average&lt;/a&gt; of all of these scores out of ten.  We then calculate the average score for a product based on each of these average review scores.  This is what will give us the 9/10 for the k800i.&lt;br /&gt;
The score breakdown is based on an average per question for this product versus the average per question for every product the same category as this one (hmmm, again, that&amp;#8217;s not very clear either).  As a contrived example, let&amp;#8217;s assume that we have two mobile phones, each with one review.  The first mobile phone (a very basic model) is awarded 6/10 for &amp;#8216;features&amp;#8217;.  The second mobile (a newer, all singing, all dancing model) is awarded 10/10 for &amp;#8216;features&amp;#8217;.  We calculate the average &amp;#8216;features&amp;#8217; score for mobile phones as 8/10 (6 + 10 / 2).  We use this data to state that the first mobile is &amp;#8216;below average&amp;#8217;, while the second mobile is &amp;#8216;above average&amp;#8217;, in the &amp;#8216;features&amp;#8217; department.  Does that make sense?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;I don&amp;#8217;t really understand the score breakdown.&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;See the above explanation and the one in the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.reevoo.com/pages/faqs#scores&quot;&gt;Faq&lt;/a&gt;.  If this is still unclear to folks then we should flesh it out a little further.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;I&amp;#8217;d like to see ratings against similar products in the &amp;#8216;Other products like this&amp;#8217; section.&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#8217;ve added a &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User_story&quot;&gt;story&lt;/a&gt; to our development schedule that should hopefully see this feature added in the near future.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;I&amp;#8217;m having problems navigating the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.reevoo.com/pages/faqs&quot;&gt;Faq&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Unfortunately I&amp;#8217;ve never been able to replicate this problem.  Are people still experiencing it?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;I want to be able to filter the search results so that I&amp;#8217;m not too overwhelmed when I search for a relatively generic term (e.g. &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.reevoo.com/search?q=phone&quot;&gt;phone&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We&amp;#8217;ve added the ability to filter your search results by product category.  Having just searched for &amp;#8216;phone&amp;#8217;, I get the option to filter by &amp;#8216;Cordless phone&amp;#8217;, &amp;#8216;Cordless phone with answering machine&amp;#8217;, &amp;#8216;landline phones&amp;#8217;, &amp;#8216;mobile phone accessories&amp;#8217;, &amp;#8216;mobile phones&amp;#8217; and a further 24 categories.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;I don&amp;#8217;t understand what the quartile link is that appears on the left hand side of a category page.&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And neither do I :-)  Don&amp;#8217;t worry though, because we&amp;#8217;ve removed it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;I want to know why the comments on the google map don&amp;#8217;t always appear where they should.&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This&amp;#8217;ll be because the description of the location is completely separate from the location itself.  The description of the location is entered by the reviewer when they complete the review.  Although we ask for the town, they could actually enter anything they wish.  As we didn&amp;#8217;t think this data would be reliable enough to plot points on the map, we use the first bit of the delivery postcode instead.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;I want products to have a human friendly name, Canon 4000 &lt;span class=&quot;caps&quot;&gt;SLR&lt;/span&gt; instead of Canon &lt;span class=&quot;caps&quot;&gt;EOS&lt;/span&gt; 400D, for example.&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#8217;m a bit confused by this as the &lt;span class=&quot;caps&quot;&gt;EOS&lt;/span&gt; 400D seems to be how &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.canon.co.uk/eos400d&quot;&gt;Canon&lt;/a&gt; (it&amp;#8217;s sad but that&amp;#8217;s a great url) refer to it.  I&amp;#8217;m also slightly confused as it seems we label this particular product as a Canon 4000 &lt;span class=&quot;caps&quot;&gt;SLR&lt;/span&gt; when it appears on the homepage, but as the &lt;span class=&quot;caps&quot;&gt;EOS&lt;/span&gt; 400D on the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.reevoo.com/reviews/mpn/canon/eos_4000_slr&quot;&gt;product page&lt;/a&gt;.  Does anyone else have any examples of misnamed products?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;I want it to be obvious that the scores are out of ten.&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This has been raised a couple of times internally and I personally agree that it&amp;#8217;s not very clear.  I&amp;#8217;m not sure that we&amp;#8217;ve come to any decisions yet though.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;I want to be able to buy a product from your site.&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You can!  Well, in some cases.  We use &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.shopping.com&quot;&gt;shopping.com&lt;/a&gt; to provide us with links to retailer sites that you can purchase the product from.  Just click on the shopping basket at the top of the product page, select the retailer you&amp;#8217;re interested in and go buy it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;NB1.&lt;/strong&gt; This is how we make money on reevoo.com.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;NB2.&lt;/strong&gt; As much as I think this sounds like one of the made up entries you see in some Faqs (&amp;#8220;I love your site/product and want to give you some money, please tell me how&amp;#8221;), I can assure you that it&amp;#8217;s not.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;I&amp;#8217;m not sure about the language of some of the commentary on the site.&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hmm, this isn&amp;#8217;t too specific so I&amp;#8217;m not sure there&amp;#8217;s much I can say really&amp;#8230;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;I prefer the selected tabs (no underline) to the unselected tabs (with an underline).&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I agree that there is some inconsistency but I think we really wanted to make it obvious that the tabs were indeed links.  I believe there may also be some accessibility issues with using images as links.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;I find it difficult to navigate the super category pages due to the long list of links down the left hand side.&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As mentioned in one of the responses above, we now only display the five most popular categories (as decided by the reevoo gods) when you first visit the page, giving you the option to show all if you wish.  This should hopefully make it a little more manageable.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Points raised by individuals&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;I don&amp;#8217;t like the spelling errors in the reviews.&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#8217;m afraid there&amp;#8217;s absolutely nothing we can do about this.  Apart from &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.reevoo.com/pages/faqs#not_published&quot;&gt;rejecting&lt;/a&gt; some reviews we don&amp;#8217;t touch them.  Although, maybe we could do our bit for north/south relations and see if one is more literate than the other :-)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;I don&amp;#8217;t immediately relate your &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.reevoo.com/images/favicon.ico&quot;&gt;favicon&lt;/a&gt; to your branding.&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That&amp;#8217;s probably a fair point.  I think that that little logo used to be one of our strong identifiers but I&amp;#8217;m wondering if it&amp;#8217;s now the orange colour instead.  I&amp;#8217;ll pass the point on and see what others think.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;I want all of the same type of product to appear in the same category, e.g. &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.reevoo.com/browse/product_type/In+Ear&quot;&gt;in-ear headphones&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.reevoo.com/browse/product_type/Headphones&quot;&gt;&amp;#8216;normal&amp;#8217; headphones&lt;/a&gt; should appear together.&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I agree that this isn&amp;#8217;t currently very good.  We use a company called &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.encodex.com&quot;&gt;Encodex&lt;/a&gt; for our product data.  Although we try to sanitize that data (removing useless facets like &amp;#8216;quartile&amp;#8217; for example) we still have someway to go.  We were actually discussing this yesterday and a &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User_story&quot;&gt;story&lt;/a&gt; should be on its way into the development schedule pretty soon.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;I couldn&amp;#8217;t find any Sony mobile phones.&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#8217;m not sure why as they are certainly &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.reevoo.com/search?q=sony+mobile+phone&quot;&gt;there&lt;/a&gt; now.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;I&amp;#8217;m not sure that the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.reevoo.com/pages/about_revieworld&quot;&gt;about us&lt;/a&gt; page is professional enough.&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It looks OK to me but then I have a feeling that it may have been changed since this suggestion was made.  Do people still have concerns about it?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;I find it hard to differentiate between the light blue text and the darker blue hyperlinks on certain pages, e.g. the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.reevoo.com/pages/faqs&quot;&gt;Faq&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I understand the concern but I&amp;#8217;m not sure whether it&amp;#8217;s something we&amp;#8217;re currently worried about.  Maybe we need to look at whether people ever click on the links from the Faq page.  If they don&amp;#8217;t then it either suggests that they are not interested in the content or that they can&amp;#8217;t see the links.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;I can&amp;#8217;t easily get back to the home page.  There&amp;#8217;s a little &amp;#8216;home&amp;#8217; link in the breadcrumbs but nothing more obvious.&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You can always click on the reevoo logo that appears on the top left to get back to the homepage.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;I want to see at a glance whether a score is an average for the product or from just one review.&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The actual suggestion was to make the product scores a different colour.  Although we could do it, I&amp;#8217;m not sure about the benefits.  After all, even the scores from the individual reviews are actually an average of all the scores from that review (explained in more detail above).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;I want to know whether you round up or down and whether you use decimal points in your scores.&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Good question (read &amp;#8211; I don&amp;#8217;t know the answer off the top of my head).  There&amp;#8217;s probably a moderate amount of work to get the definitive answer so I&amp;#8217;ll look into this separately and maybe add it to the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.reevoo.com/pages/faqs&quot;&gt;Faq&lt;/a&gt; or to a page in the &lt;a href=&quot;http://groups.google.com/group/reevoo-website&quot;&gt;group&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;I searched for something and got five pages of results.  Only four of those pages had any content.&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This was a &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=Schoolboy+Error&quot;&gt;schoolboy error&lt;/a&gt; on our part.  The paging was calculated on 10 products per page yet we were displaying 12.  Oops.  All fixed now.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;I&amp;#8217;d like to be able to remove a filter independently of the rest.&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Interesting suggestion and definitely something that has been discussed in the past.  I&amp;#8217;ll get it raised as a &lt;a href=&quot;http://wikipedia.org/wiki/user_story&quot;&gt;story&lt;/a&gt; and see if it gets prioritised.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;I&amp;#8217;m able to close the balloons on the google map.&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hmm, so you are.  Although I think we&amp;#8217;ve removed the functionality to close a balloon by clicking anywhere on the map, I don&amp;#8217;t believe we can remove the ability to close them altogether.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;I&amp;#8217;d like to have a list of recently viewed products.&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Can&amp;#8217;t you use the back button?  Sorry :-)  This has been discussed in the past.  The best I can do right now is get it raised as a &lt;a href=&quot;http://wikipedia.org/wiki/user_story&quot;&gt;story&lt;/a&gt; and see if it gets prioritised.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;I searched for &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.reevoo.com/search?q=orange&quot;&gt;orange&lt;/a&gt; and got a &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.reevoo.com/reviews/ean/5390660094286&quot;&gt;Creative Zen Micro&lt;/a&gt; in my search results but couldn&amp;#8217;t understand why.&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That&amp;#8217;ll be because we have some top-secret (read, legacy) content that is searched but not displayed.  There&amp;#8217;s a &lt;a href=&quot;http://wikipedia.org/wiki/user_story&quot;&gt;story&lt;/a&gt; for this that&amp;#8217;s waiting to be prioritised.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;I want people to be able to leave a review for a product.  This would be especially useful for products that currently don&amp;#8217;t have reviews.&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We used to offer this functionality but &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.reevoo.com/blogs/reevooblog/2006/12/21/add-a-review-its-been-removed&quot;&gt;withdrew it&lt;/a&gt; in December 2006.  I&amp;#8217;m pretty certain that it&amp;#8217;s not something that we&amp;#8217;re considering re-implementing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;I want to see the list of categories (currently appearing under the search box) higher up the homepage.&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I agree that it isn&amp;#8217;t immediately obvious (especially with a lower screen resolution) how you might navigate into the site from the homepage.  As with assessing whether or not the google map should stay on the homepage, I think we&amp;#8217;ll need to look at how many people disappear straight from the homepage and decide whether we want to play around with the layout in order to reduce it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;I want it to be made very clear that I can&amp;#8217;t leave a review on the site.&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The three step diagram at the bottom of the homepage was intended to convey this idea.  Maybe people don&amp;#8217;t look at it because it&amp;#8217;s too low down the page (it appears &amp;#8216;below the fold&amp;#8217; for the 45% of our visitors that have their screen resolution set to 1024&amp;#215;768), or maybe it just isn&amp;#8217;t very clear?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;I was confused by the separation of the review content from the google map, on the homepage.&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I agree and actually think I may have made it slightly more confusing, as there is now a small delay between the balloon appearing on the map and the review showing on the right hand side of the homepage&amp;#8230;  I guess we&amp;#8217;ll look into this as part of the slightly bigger issue of the homepage in general.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;I&amp;#8217;m not sure the plus and minus icons will be clear enough for people that need textual signposts to help them.&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I assume you are referring to the accessibility of the site to visually impaired users.  If so, is our use of the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.w3.org/TR/html401/struct/objects.html#adef-alt&quot;&gt;alt tag&lt;/a&gt; not sufficient?  We currently have the alternative text of the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.reevoo.com/images/plus.gif&quot;&gt;plus&lt;/a&gt; image as &amp;#8216;good points&amp;#8217;, and the alternative text of the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.reevoo.com/images/minus.gif&quot;&gt;minus&lt;/a&gt; image as &amp;#8216;bad points&amp;#8217;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;I struggled to find the paging on a supercategory page, as it was hidden right at the very bottom of the page.&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Two things should help this situation.  The first is that the long list of categories on the left side of the page now default to be only five long, and the second is that we&amp;#8217;ve removed the paging :-)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;I want to know how many times a review has been voted useful or useless when ordering reviews by &amp;#8216;useful&amp;#8217;.&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#8217;ll add a &lt;a href=&quot;http://wikipedia.org/wiki/user_story&quot;&gt;story&lt;/a&gt; to the development schedule and see whether it gets prioritised.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;I don&amp;#8217;t understand what &amp;#8216;elsewhere on the web&amp;#8217; means and why it sometimes displays with nothing below it.&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This has been added in an attempt to make reevoo.com one of the first places to come to when you want product information.  We currently use the &lt;a href=&quot;http://developer.yahoo.com/search&quot;&gt;yahoo search api&lt;/a&gt; to search a preset list of domains (e.g. &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.bbc.co.uk&quot;&gt;bbc.co.uk&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.t3.co.uk&quot;&gt;t3.co.uk&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.engadget.com&quot;&gt;engadget&lt;/a&gt;) for information related to the product you are looking at.  We also currently search &lt;a href=&quot;http://answers.yahoo.com&quot;&gt;Yahoo answers&lt;/a&gt; and are planning to add many more in the near future.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;I only seem to be able to filter by one facet at a time.&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Um, you can definitely filter by multiple facets.  Take &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.reevoo.com/browse/product_type/mobile_phones/product_brand/Nokia/Connectivity/Bluetooth/Design/Slider/MP3%252FATRAC%2BPlayback/Yes&quot;&gt;All bluetooth and Mp3 enabled Nokia mobile phones that have a sliding front&lt;/a&gt; as an example.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;I sometimes get strange results in the pricing table.  Take this &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.reevoo.com/reviews/mpn/hp/psc1610&quot;&gt;HP Cartridge&lt;/a&gt;, that lists ten entries for &amp;#8216;Cartridge &lt;span class=&quot;caps&quot;&gt;SAVE&lt;/span&gt;&amp;#8217; all at ¬£23.00, as an example.&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I believe this is to do with the data that we are receiving from &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.shopping.com&quot;&gt;shopping.com&lt;/a&gt; (our pricing provider).  Every link in that list has a different &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/URL&quot;&gt;Url&lt;/a&gt; but they all end up at the same page, maybe suggesting that cartridgesave.co.uk have that link registered multiple times with shopping.com.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;I find that the high number of anonymous reviews lessens my trust in the promise that all reviews are from genuine customers.&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Fair point.  I guess all I can do is assure you that we will only invite confirmed purchasers of a product to review said product.  Honest.  We want to allow people to leave anonymous reviews in the hope that we&amp;#8217;ll get more coverage than if people were forced to enter their details.  Having said that I&amp;#8217;m not sure we&amp;#8217;ve ever measured the difference between the two approaches (i.e. requiring some personal details versus allowing people to remain anonymous).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;I don&amp;#8217;t know for sure what the bold statements at the bottom of a review represent.  I guess they are general comments but I&amp;#8217;m not 100% sure.&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They are indeed general comments although I agree that it&amp;#8217;s not immediately obvious.  Maybe we need a little icon, like the plus and minus icons, that people can immediately identify.  I&amp;#8217;ll raise it as a &lt;a href=&quot;http://wikipedia.org/wiki/user_story&quot;&gt;story&lt;/a&gt; and we&amp;#8217;ll see if it gets prioritised.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;I have to scroll down to see all of the homepage.&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hmm, I&amp;#8217;ve noticed this too.  With a resolution of 1024&amp;#215;768 (which is the resolution of choice for 45% of our visitors) the three panel display at the bottom of the home page is completely cut off.  Maybe we should at least try to fit the homepage within this resolution.  I&amp;#8217;ll float the idea and see if it generates a &lt;a href=&quot;http://wikipedia.org/wiki/user_story&quot;&gt;story&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;I can&amp;#8217;t see the beginning of each link under the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.reevoo.com/categories&quot;&gt;browse all categories&lt;/a&gt; heading on the homepage.&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This was identified as problem with Internet Explorer 6 and has since been fixed&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;I always want the number of search results to appear next to the name of the product category on the supercategory page.  If the product category is too long then the number of results drops to the next line (e.g. Audio Home Systems in the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.reevoo.com/browse/group/Phones+%26+Computing&quot;&gt;Phones and Computing&lt;/a&gt; supercategory)&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I agree that this doesn&amp;#8217;t look great, although I&amp;#8217;m not sure it impacts the user experience too much.  I&amp;#8217;ll get a &lt;a href=&quot;http://wikipedia.org/wiki/user_story&quot;&gt;story&lt;/a&gt; written up for it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;I see the product specification panel appear below all of the reviews on some product pages.&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This was found to be a problem on pages where the &lt;a href=&quot;http://answers.yahoo.com&quot;&gt;yahoo answers&lt;/a&gt; that we received were too long for their container.  The problem only occurred in Internet Explorer 6 and has now been fixed.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

        <title>Holiday in Newqay</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;We&amp;#8217;ve been camping in &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Newquay&quot;&gt;Newquay&lt;/a&gt; for the past week.  I just thought I&amp;#8217;d post a few unstructured notes about our time there.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;It took about six hours each way in the car.  Much better than last year&amp;#8217;s nine or ten hour journeys each way.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;The weather was amazing.  Given the miserable forecast before we left, it couldn&amp;#8217;t have been any better.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;We stayed at &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.trencreekholidaypark.co.uk&quot;&gt;Trencreek campsite&lt;/a&gt;.  It was a good site about 15-20 minutes walk away from the northern end of town (coming out opposite &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.tolcarnebeach.com&quot;&gt;Tolcarne Beach&lt;/a&gt;).  Along with the no single sex parties or &lt;a href=&quot;http://ademweb.co.uk/blog/?p=750&quot;&gt;single people&lt;/a&gt; rule, they didn&amp;#8217;t have any card facilities and requested that you to park on the right hand side of your tent &amp;#8211; maybe they could modernise just a little&amp;#8230;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Spent some time at &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fistral_Beach&quot;&gt;Fistral beach&lt;/a&gt;, watching the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.ripcurlboardmasters.com&quot;&gt;Ripcurl Boardmasters&lt;/a&gt; surfing competition, drinking &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Foster%27s_Lager&quot;&gt;Fosters&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bodyboarding&quot;&gt;body boarding&lt;/a&gt;.  The South African commentator suggested that his mate took &lt;a href=&quot;http://img.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2007/08_01/whiteSWNS00808_468x331.jpg&quot;&gt;the picture&lt;/a&gt; of the &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Great_white&quot;&gt;great white&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_africa&quot;&gt;South Africa&lt;/a&gt; a good few years ago (a story that seems to be confirmed by the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.guardian.co.uk/frontpage/story/0,,2144756,00.html&quot;&gt;Guardian&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Bought a &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Skimboard&quot;&gt;skimboard&lt;/a&gt; and fell off hard at least twice.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Bought a bar for my &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.peterlynnkites.co.nz&quot;&gt;kite&lt;/a&gt; from &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.airjam.co.uk&quot;&gt;Airjam&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Had a good meal at the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.fistral-blu.co.uk&quot;&gt;Fistral Blue&lt;/a&gt; restaurant and took some pics of the &lt;a href=&quot;http://flickr.com/photos/chrisjroos/1096710292/in/set-72157601392983638&quot;&gt;sunset&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Had a rushed meal at the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.maharajah-restaurant.co.uk&quot;&gt;Maharajah&lt;/a&gt; restaurant.  Tip to restaurant owners, asking us to finish our drinks in another restaurant across the street (even if it does belong to you) will not make us want to come back.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Took in the &lt;a href=&quot;http://flickr.com/photos/chrisjroos/1096871898/in/set-72157601392983638&quot;&gt;amazing views&lt;/a&gt; along the coastal path from Newquay, via Porth to Watergate Bay for the Ripcurl unleashed music festival.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Got to the festival site without any cash only to discover that there were no card facilities anywhere.  Having walked for an hour and ten minutes to get there, we had to pay ¬£10 for a cab to take us back, virtually all the way to the campsite, to withdraw some money.  Ho hum.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At the festival, we saw:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.ffaf.co.uk&quot;&gt;Funeral for a Friend&lt;/a&gt;.  So much harder live than on their albums.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.ash-official.com&quot;&gt;Ash&lt;/a&gt;.  I only really know their &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.amazon.co.uk/1977-Ash/dp/B0000274GW&quot;&gt;old stuff&lt;/a&gt; so it was cool that that was what they mainly played.  It makes me wonder if that&amp;#8217;s a sign that their newer stuff isn&amp;#8217;t selling quite so well though&amp;#8230;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.newtonfaulkner.com&quot;&gt;Newton Faulkner&lt;/a&gt;.  Only caught the last three songs but was impressed with what I saw.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.scottmatthewsmusic.co.uk&quot;&gt;Scott Matthews&lt;/a&gt;.  Boring.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.guillemots.com&quot;&gt;The Guillemots&lt;/a&gt;.  Boring.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.paolonutini.com&quot;&gt;Paolo Nutini&lt;/a&gt;.  Although the albums are pretty boring, he&amp;#8217;s pretty cool live (having originally seen him at Isle of White festival).  It was a bit of a shame that he was so drunk as his strong accent is hard enough to understand at the best of times.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.mattandkimmusic.com&quot;&gt;Mat and Kim&lt;/a&gt;.  An amazingly energetic band from New York that played in front of maybe 100 people in the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.relentlessenergy.com&quot;&gt;relentless&lt;/a&gt; tent.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wakeboarding&quot;&gt;Wakeboarding&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wake_skating&quot;&gt;Wakeskating&lt;/a&gt; at the relentless tour.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Freestyle_Motocross&quot;&gt;Freestyle motorcross&lt;/a&gt; with the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.myspace.com/ukfmx&quot;&gt;UK &lt;span class=&quot;caps&quot;&gt;FMX&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt; team.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All in all, a good week.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

        <title>A new reevoo.com</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;This is obviously completely optional but if anyone stumbles across this post, I&amp;#8217;d really appreciate it if you&amp;#8217;d spend a few minutes checking out the revised &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.reevoo.com&quot;&gt;reevoo.com&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I don&amp;#8217;t want to say too much as I want to influence any judgement.  Just check it out and let me know what you think, either in the comments here or by &lt;a href=&quot;mailto:chrisroos@reevoo.com&quot;&gt;email&lt;/a&gt;.  Oh, and really don&amp;#8217;t be scared to slag it off, praise it up or just sit on the fence &amp;#8211; any opinion is welcome.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Oh, and in case it&amp;#8217;s not obvious, I work at Reevoo.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

        <title>Train times by SMS (or, improving national rail enquiries)</title>
        <description>&lt;div class=&quot;notice&quot;&gt;This service is no longer running.  Please see &lt;a href=&quot;/blog/2009-01-31-turning-off-my-national-rail-twitter-bot&quot;&gt;this post&lt;/a&gt; if you&amp;#8217;re interested to find out why.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I was in need of finding some train times at the weekend.  I usually use the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.nationalrail.co.uk&quot;&gt;national rail enquiries&lt;/a&gt; website but was without Internet access at the time.  Instead, I found myself waiting for about 10 minutes in a telephone queue just to spend about 30 seconds getting the information I was after.  This played on my mind a bit so last night I started &lt;a href=&quot;http://twitter.com/chrisroos/statuses/164273922&quot;&gt;playing around&lt;/a&gt; with automating the national rail timetable search.  That was relatively painless so I moved on to integrating with &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.twitter.com&quot;&gt;twitter&lt;/a&gt; in order to provide an &lt;span class=&quot;caps&quot;&gt;SMS&lt;/span&gt; interface to the service.  Within a couple of hours I had a twitterbot that receives timetable requests, looks up the times and sends them back to you.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#8217;s actually currently all up and running.  Just follow &lt;a href=&quot;http://twitter.com/natrailenq&quot;&gt;natrailenq&lt;/a&gt; on twitter and I&amp;#8217;ll follow you right back&lt;sup class=&quot;footnote&quot; id=&quot;fnr1&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn1&quot;&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; (this seems to be necessary in order to send direct messages between each other).  A timetable request must be of the format &amp;#8216;origin_station (3 letter short code) destination_station (3 letter short code) depart_date (dd-mmmm) depart_time (hh:mm)&amp;#8217;.  So, if we wanted to get times of trains from London Victoria (&lt;span class=&quot;caps&quot;&gt;VIC&lt;/span&gt;) to Clapham Junction (&lt;span class=&quot;caps&quot;&gt;CLJ&lt;/span&gt;) tomorrow midday, we&amp;#8217;d send a message like so:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class=&quot;code&quot;&gt;
d natrailenq vic clj 25-july 12:00
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this instance, we get the following response back.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class=&quot;code&quot;&gt;
natrailenq  11:55-&amp;gt;12:02, 12:02-&amp;gt;12:07, 12:03-&amp;gt;12:09, 12:05-&amp;gt;12:11, 12:06-&amp;gt;12:11
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Cool huh.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The code is &lt;strong&gt;nasty&lt;/strong&gt;.  You can see just how nasty it in the &lt;a href=&quot;http://chrisroos.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/nat-rail-enq/&quot;&gt;repository&lt;/a&gt;.  It feels as though this could go somewhere &amp;#8211; unless I&amp;#8217;m violating some terms and conditions that I haven&amp;#8217;t read&amp;#8230;  I make no guarantees as to how long the service will stay live, and I will certainly (probably) remove it if asked to.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;footnote&quot; id=&quot;fn1&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fnr1&quot;&gt;&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/a&gt; Well, just as soon as I can at least &amp;#8211; it&amp;#8217;s not automated at the moment.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

        <title>Free google website optimizer isn't actually free</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;Nup, it cost me ¬£5.00.  That&amp;#8217;s not free is it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;OK, so I&amp;#8217;m being intentionally blunt, but that&amp;#8217;s because &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.google.com&quot;&gt;google&lt;/a&gt; annoyed me by being misleading and incompetent.  Although I have no intention of using &lt;a href=&quot;http://adwords.google.com&quot;&gt;adwords&lt;/a&gt;, I had to sign-up in order to use their &lt;a href=&quot;http://services.google.com/websiteoptimizer&quot;&gt;website optimizer&lt;/a&gt; service.  I signed up but chose not to enter any billing information; I wasn&amp;#8217;t going to buy any ads, and website optimizer is free (hmmm), so I didn&amp;#8217;t see the point.  I went on to set-up my optimizer experiments and waited.  The docs suggest that you may have to wait up to an hour before seeing impressions, but 24 hours without impressions, that I knew should be there, seemed a little excessive.  I guessed it may have had something to do with not entering my billing information but in order to be sure I sent the folks at google an email.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Chris&lt;/strong&gt; I&amp;#8217;ve set-up my website optimizer campaigns and all seems correct.  Unfortunately, they are not showing any impressions or clickthrus.  I wonder if this is because I haven&amp;#8217;t activated (i.e. set-up my payment information) in my adwords account.  As I don&amp;#8217;t intend to use adwords, I didn&amp;#8217;t really want to have to do it.  Could this be the reason?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I thought I was being fairly clear in my questioning, but apparently not.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Adwords&lt;/strong&gt; Thank you for your email regarding why you are not accruing any clicks or impression for your ad. I noticed that you have not entered your billing information. Below, I address this in detail.&lt;br /&gt;
I have reviewed your AdWords account and found that your ad is not appearing on Google because you have not yet entered your billing information. Entering valid billing information is required to activate your Google AdWords account and begin running your ads.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Surely it should be common practice to read the email before replying.  Obviously not.  Oh well, I&amp;#8217;ll get back to them (in an admittedly sarcastic tone).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Chris&lt;/strong&gt; Any chance you can re-read my original query and answer that, rather than essentially ignoring it?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Surely they&amp;#8217;ll read it this time&amp;#8230;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Adwords&lt;/strong&gt; Thank you for your email. I understand you would like to know why your ads are not receiving any clicks and impressions. Upon reviewing your account, I found that this is because your account has not been activated. To activate your account and to receive clicks and impressions you will have to enter your billing details&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nope.  Let&amp;#8217;s try one more time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Chris&lt;/strong&gt; I haven&amp;#8217;t mentioned anything about adwords ads.  My problem is, in fact with Website Optimizer.  Do I need to enter billing information just to use website optimizer, or is there another reason that I&amp;#8217;m not recording any hits?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Woot, we get an answer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Adwords&lt;/strong&gt; The Website Optimizer is integrated into your AdWords account, you will need to enter your billing information to use it. In order to use Website Optimizer, you&amp;#8217;ll need a Standard AdWords account.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Right, so we finally have a sensible answer.  In fact, I think this is probably covered in &lt;a href=&quot;https://adwords.google.com/support/bin/index.py?fulldump=1#55902&quot;&gt;this&lt;/a&gt; answer, assuming that &amp;#8220;active&amp;#8221; means &amp;#8220;with correct billing information&amp;#8221;.  What about the ¬£5.00 I had to pay to get set-up, of which there is no mention until the very last stage of sign-up?  Well, it actually seems that this is covered too, in &lt;a href=&quot;http://adwords.google.com/support/bin/answer.py?hl=en&amp;amp;answer=31756&quot;&gt;this&lt;/a&gt; answer, mentioning a &amp;#8220;nominal setup fee&amp;#8221; to create an adwords account.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In all fairness, the big G (not His Dad, the other one) has probably not done anything wrong, but it&amp;#8217;s certainly not very transparent.  You have to pay to activate an adwords account and you need an adwords account in order to use website optimizer.  Or, website optimizer costs a fiver.  There, much easier to understand.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

        <title>Web service to convert UK Postcodes (outcode) to Latitude and Longitude</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;Using the data supplied in this &lt;a href=&quot;http://postcodes.easypeasy.com&quot;&gt;article&lt;/a&gt;, by &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.niksargent.com&quot;&gt;Nik Sargent&lt;/a&gt;, I&amp;#8217;ve created a simple web service that returns &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.json.org&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;caps&quot;&gt;JSON&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt; formatted data about UK Outcodes (the first bit of the postcode).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The idea is that you can request, for example, /postcodes/se1 and get some json in return.  For se1, we receive the following data.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class=&quot;code javascript&quot;&gt;
{&quot;latitude&quot;:&quot;51.498&quot;,&quot;x&quot;:&quot;532600&quot;,&quot;postcode&quot;:&quot;SE1&quot;,&quot;y&quot;:&quot;179500&quot;,&quot;longitude&quot;:&quot;51.498&quot;}
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The service is currently running at &lt;a href=&quot;http://seagul.co.uk/postcodes&quot;&gt;http://seagul.co.uk/postcodes&lt;/a&gt; (&lt;a href=&quot;http://seagul.co.uk/postcodes/se1&quot;&gt;se1&lt;/a&gt;) but I make no guarantees as to its reliability.  I&amp;#8217;d suggest that if anyone actually finds this useful that they go host it somewhere for themselves in order to control the availability.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The code is, as always, on &lt;a href=&quot;http://chrisroos.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/uk-postcodes/&quot;&gt;google code&lt;/a&gt; and pasted below.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#8217;ve created it as a proof of concept but I figure that, given a little love, it may prove useful to some folks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class=&quot;code ruby&quot;&gt;
require &#39;rubygems&#39;
require &#39;mongrel&#39;
require &#39;json&#39;

postcodes_file = File.dirname(__FILE__) + &#39;/uk-postcodes.json&#39;
Postcodes = JSON.parse(File.open(postcodes_file) { |f| f.read })
Index = Postcodes.inject([]) { |index, postcode| index &amp;lt;&amp;lt; postcode[&#39;postcode&#39;].downcase }

class PostcodeHandler &amp;lt; Mongrel::HttpHandler
  def process(request, response)
    outcode = request.params[&#39;PATH_INFO&#39;].sub(/^\//, &#39;&#39;).downcase
    postcode_index = Index.index(outcode)
    if postcode_index
      response.start do |head, out|
        head[&quot;Content-Type&quot;] = &quot;text/plain&quot;
        out &amp;lt;&amp;lt; Postcodes[postcode_index].to_json
      end
    else
      response.start(404) do |head,out|
        out &amp;lt;&amp;lt; &quot;Postcode not found\n&quot;
      end
    end
  end
end

config = Mongrel::Configurator.new :host =&amp;gt; &#39;localhost&#39;, :port =&amp;gt; &#39;4000&#39; do
  listener do
    uri &quot;/postcodes&quot;, :handler =&amp;gt; PostcodeHandler.new
  end
  trap(&quot;INT&quot;) { stop }
  run
end

config.join
&lt;/pre&gt;</description>

        <title>Wesabe open up their API and ask me to help write their press release...</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;Ok, so that second bit isn&amp;#8217;t strictly true ;-)  I was, however, flattered to be contacted by Debbie from &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.wesabe.com&quot;&gt;Wesabe&lt;/a&gt; to answer a few questions and maybe provide a quote for their press release.  They have just improved their service by &lt;a href=&quot;http://blog.wesabe.com/index.php/2007/07/12/your-bank-has-a-rest-api-now-shhh-dont-tell-them/&quot;&gt;offering&lt;/a&gt; an &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.wikipedia.org/wiki/API&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;caps&quot;&gt;API&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt; after all.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They asked, and I answered by rambling quite a bit.  In the preview of the press release I&amp;#8217;ve seen, my ramblings have been summarized in three words :-)  Hey, I&amp;#8217;m just honoured they asked.  I also asked if I could post their questions and my reply here, so, in all its glory, here it be.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Debbie Pfeifer&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hey, Chris.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I work with Marc Hedlund at Wesabe.  I know he gave you a heads up that we&amp;#8217;re working on releasing an &lt;span class=&quot;caps&quot;&gt;API&lt;/span&gt;.  We&amp;#8217;re getting close &amp;#8211; we plan to get it out either late this week or early next week &amp;#8211; and I was writing to ask for a favor.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#8217;m putting together a press release announcing the &lt;span class=&quot;caps&quot;&gt;API&lt;/span&gt; and we thought it would be cool to get a quote from a developer who has done some hacks.  If you&amp;#8217;d rather not participate, no worries whatsoever.  If you&amp;#8217;d be willing, following is a quick list of questions:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Chris Roos&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Cool, I appreciate being considered.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Debbie Pfeifer&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Why do you use Wesabe?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Chris Roos&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Because it&amp;#8217;s a great application :-)   No, seriously it&amp;#8217;s because tagging makes sense to me.  It makes sense that, if I buy an apple, I should be able to categorise it as an apple, fruit, lunch, food, groceries and others that I can&amp;#8217;t think of right now.  It&amp;#8217;s a bit looser than traditional finance applications which I find perfect.  I must admit that I don&amp;#8217;t currently use the social side of wesabe, helping others out with tips and advice, but that in no way detracts from the usefulness of the service to me.  I also love the fact that I&amp;#8217;m able to interact with you guys, it means a lot to know that you&amp;#8217;re listening.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Debbie Pfeifer&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;From your blog, I saw the projects you&amp;#8217;ve already done (automating downloads).  Are there other things you&amp;#8217;d like to do with Wesabe once you have the &lt;span class=&quot;caps&quot;&gt;API&lt;/span&gt;?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Chris Roos&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hmm, let&amp;#8217;s see.  I&amp;#8217;m a big fan of the command line.  I&amp;#8217;ve already been thinking about tidying up some of the previous work I&amp;#8217;ve done so that it effectively provides a command line interface to my banking websites.  I can see that a command line interface to Wesabe might be quite appealing to me too.  I&amp;#8217;m just wondering about some potential mapping mashups too.  I try to tag my transactions with the place they were purchased. Assuming I tagged every purchase with at least a town or city it&amp;#8217;d be cool to see the distribution geographically.  Actually, I have a feeling I could do this with what&amp;#8217;s available right now so maybe scrap that thought.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Debbie Pfeifer&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Anything else you&amp;#8217;d like to add?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Chris Roos&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I originally had this bit under the question of why I like Wesabe, but felt it best here.  To be fair, it probably doesn&amp;#8217;t matter too much. Anyway, I like the fact that Wesabe is developing the software that my greedy, super-rich banks should be developing ;-)   I love the fact that you are, in a small way, changing the world.  Sticking two fingers up at traditional finance applications and banking web apps themselves, because, I assume, you know that you&amp;#8217;re doing it right.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One other idea I&amp;#8217;ve been thinking about is uploading my mobile phone statements to Wesabe.  I currently have access to a pdf representation of my itemised bill.  I&amp;#8217;m thinking that if I can parse the pdf, or even just copy the content into a text file that I can parse, I could upload and use all the features of Wesabe to analyse my bills.  I think this&amp;#8217;d be great as I&amp;#8217;ve personally never come across a phone company that allows ready, easy access to itemised call data in a useful format.  I guess this is because they don&amp;#8217;t want to make it to easy for us to work out that they&amp;#8217;re screwing us over in some way (cynical huh?).  Anyway, just a thought and I&amp;#8217;m obviously not sure how that&amp;#8217;d sit with you guys&amp;#8230;?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Debbie Pfeifer&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Again, if you&amp;#8217;d rather not do this, I totally understand.  If you&amp;#8217;re game, could we use your name?  Also, how would you describe yourself&amp;#8230; a (your job) from (city)?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Chris Roos&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Feel free to use my name.  Although not really one for titles, I guess I&amp;#8217;d be classed as a software developer working in London, but from Ramsgate.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Debbie Pfeifer&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thanks, Chris.  Please let me know if you have any questions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Chris Roos&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One quick question.  Am I able to publish this email to my blog?  If not, I&amp;#8217;ll probably just published my answers to your questions, which I could paraphrase to offer context.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Cheers, and hope there&amp;#8217;s at least something useful in these ramblings.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Chris&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Debbie Pfeifer&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Best,&lt;br /&gt;
Debbie Pfeifer&lt;br /&gt;
Wesabe&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Update 17:10 &amp;#8211; made the email legible. Thanks Paul.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description>

        <title>A great day at work and reevoovision (twittervision for reviews)</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;A few of days ago I &lt;a href=&quot;http://twitter.com/chrisroos/statuses/114202552&quot;&gt;came across&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;http://twittervision.com/&quot;&gt;twittervision&lt;/a&gt;.  Just ten hours later I had checked some code into &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.reevoo.com&quot;&gt;our&lt;/a&gt; repository that allows us to do the same thing (as twittervision) but for our reviews.  Yup, it was a very good day indeed.  Although the initial code was complete within a few hours, it needed a bit of polishing (kudos to &lt;a href=&quot;http://po-ru.com&quot;&gt;Paul&lt;/a&gt;) which meant that we only got it deployed yesterday.  I guess one working day between proof of concept and deployment isn&amp;#8217;t that bad&amp;#8230;  Anyway, go check it out &amp;#8211; &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.reevoo.com/vision.html&quot;&gt;reevoovision&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;The days events&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I started the morning by creating an &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Xml&quot;&gt;xml&lt;/a&gt; feed of the ten most recently published reviews.  On filling a review, the reviewer is asked to enter their town, which needed to be converted to latitude/longitude to allow us to plot a point on the map.  Luckily, a little googling revealed the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.geonames.org/&quot;&gt;geonames&lt;/a&gt; web service that did exactly what I wanted.  So, using a combination of &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.ruby-lang.org/en/&quot;&gt;ruby&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;http://rubyonrails.com/&quot;&gt;rails&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;http://curl.haxx.se/&quot;&gt;curl&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;http://code.whytheluckystiff.net/hpricot/&quot;&gt;hpricot&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;http://mongrel.rubyforge.org/&quot;&gt;mongrel&lt;/a&gt; I had a simple web server that downloaded and parsed the reviews, converted place name to lat/long, and plotted the results on a google map (with help from the &lt;a href=&quot;http://pragmaticprogrammer.com/fridays.html&quot;&gt;fridays&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;http://pragmaticprogrammer.com/titles/sdgmapi2/index.html&quot;&gt;google map book&lt;/a&gt;).  A good proof of concept but not quite right.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I was reminded that we collect the purchaser&amp;#8217;s postcode from our retailers.  This, in combination with a &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.easypeasy.com/guides/article.php?article=64&quot;&gt;free list&lt;/a&gt; of UK &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UK_postcodes&quot;&gt;outcodes&lt;/a&gt; (the first bit of the postcode) against latitude/longitude, allowed for much greater accuracy (well, to within about 2km) in plotting the location of the reviewer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The next step was to polish up the rough demo.  Instead of the previous server side hackery, I used the excellent &lt;a href=&quot;http://jquery.com&quot;&gt;jquery&lt;/a&gt; javascript library to perform an &amp;#8220;Ajax&amp;#8221; request of the reviews and parse the xml to build a simple hash of the required data.  Using the twittervision source as reference, I got a &amp;#8216;proper&amp;#8217; (i.e. reviews popping up in sequence) demo running.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;From here, it was a basic case of tidying up some rough edges.  Instead of returning the reviews data as xml, I converted it to &lt;a href=&quot;http://json.org/&quot;&gt;json&lt;/a&gt; to make for trivial parsing in javascript.  I also added the jquery &lt;a href=&quot;http://jquery.com/plugins/project/dimensions&quot;&gt;dimensions&lt;/a&gt; plugin to resize the containing div, and in turn the map, to the size of the page.  The final touch was attempting to keep the UK centered in the window.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Reevoovision currently selects and displays published reviews at random to provide a constantly updating map, although maybe it&amp;#8217;d be cool to get it to display submitted/published reviews in real-time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I can&amp;#8217;t get over how addictive it is to watch the reviews pop-up all over the country, it really emphasises the fact that these are actually real people writing about their experiences.  Hmm, that sounds a bit sales &amp;amp; marketing.  I do mean it though, honest.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

        <title>Automatically downloading my Ing Direct transactions</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;I wanted to &lt;a href=&quot;/blog/2007-06-23-automatically-download-egg-credit-card-transactions&quot;&gt;automate&lt;/a&gt; the &lt;a href=&quot;/blog/2007-05-14-automatically-downloading-my-recent-transactions-from-lloyds-tsb&quot;&gt;download&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=&quot;/blog/2007-05-04-automatically-downloading-my-most-recent-hsbc-transactions&quot;&gt;transaction&lt;/a&gt; data for my &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.ingdirect.co.uk&quot;&gt;ing direct&lt;/a&gt; account.  Instead of just pasting up the finished result, I&amp;#8217;ve tried to capture the process I went through, on the off chance it&amp;#8217;s of interest to anyone&amp;#8230;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Earlier&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Open the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.ingdirect.co.uk&quot;&gt;homepage&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Click the login link. (goes to https://secure.ingdirect.co.uk/InitialINGDirect.html?command=displayLogin&amp;amp;device=web&amp;amp;locale=en_GB)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.flickr.com/photos/chrisjroos/601727552/&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://farm2.static.flickr.com/1358/601727552_238151d7e8_m.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Type our Customer Number and Last Name into the login form.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Before submitting the form, we open the &lt;a href=&quot;http://livehttpheaders.mozdev.org/&quot;&gt;Live Http headers&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.mozilla.com/en-US/firefox/&quot;&gt;firefox&lt;/a&gt; extension.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We see that the following information gets POSTed to InitialINGDirect.html&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class=&quot;code&quot;&gt;
command=enterCustomerNumber&amp;amp;locale=en_GB&amp;amp;device=web&amp;amp;ACN=&amp;lt;YOUR_CUSTOMER_NUMBER&amp;gt;&amp;amp;LNAME=&amp;lt;YOUR_LAST_NAME&amp;gt;&amp;amp;GO.x=23&amp;amp;GO.y=12
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We are redirected to a second security page.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.flickr.com/photos/chrisjroos/601727868/&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://farm2.static.flickr.com/1344/601727868_4569c11af6_m.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The first use of &lt;a href=&quot;http://curl.haxx.se/&quot;&gt;curl&lt;/a&gt; is to see whether we can get this far from the command line.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class=&quot;code shell&quot;&gt;
$ curl -X&quot;POST&quot; -d&quot;command=enterCustomerNumber&quot; -d&quot;locale=en_GB&quot; -d&quot;device=web&quot; -d&quot;ACN=YOUR_CUSTOMER_NUMBER&quot; -d&quot;LNAME=YOUR_LAST_NAME&quot; -d&quot;GO.x=23&quot; -d&quot;GO.y=12&quot; &quot;https://secure.ingdirect.co.uk/InitialINGDirect.html&quot; -o&quot;&amp;lt;FILENAME_FOR_OUTPUT&amp;gt;&quot;
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The actual output in this instance is&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class=&quot;code javascript&quot;&gt;
&amp;lt;SCRIPT&amp;gt;
location.replace(&quot;/INGDirect.html?command=displayValidateCustomer&amp;amp;fill=1&quot;);
&amp;lt;/SCRIPT&amp;gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So we amend the curl command to see exactly what&amp;#8217;s going on (the removal of -o and the addition of -v)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Right, so this is interesting &amp;#8211; I was expecting to see an &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.w3.org/Protocols/rfc2616/rfc2616-sec14.html#sec14.30&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;caps&quot;&gt;HTTP&lt;/span&gt; Location&lt;/a&gt; header directing us to the second security page.  Instead the body of the response is the javascript seen above.  I guess they want to ensure that we have javascript enabled eh.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let&amp;#8217;s just see what happens if we request the page returned in the javascript (https://secure.ingdirect.co.uk/INGDirect.html?command=displayValidateCustomer&amp;amp;fill=1)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.flickr.com/photos/chrisjroos/601442615/&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://farm2.static.flickr.com/1130/601442615_2ce8dafc21_m.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ok, so that&amp;#8217;s not unexpected.  How about, if we store the cookies sent to us in the original response, and then request the page returned in the javascript.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class=&quot;code shell&quot;&gt;
$ curl -X&quot;POST&quot; -c&quot;/Users/chrisroos/Desktop/ing-cookie&quot; -d&quot;command=enterCustomerNumber&quot; -d&quot;locale=en_GB&quot; -d&quot;device=web&quot; -d&quot;ACN=YOUR_CUSTOMER_NUMBER&quot; -d&quot;LNAME=YOUR_LAST_NAME&quot; -d&quot;GO.x=23&quot; -d&quot;GO.y=12&quot; &quot;https://secure.ingdirect.co.uk/InitialINGDirect.html&quot;

$ curl -b&quot;/Users/chrisroos/Desktop/ing-cookie&quot; &quot;https://secure.ingdirect.co.uk/INGDirect.html?command=displayValidateCustomer&amp;amp;fill=1&quot; -o&quot;/Users/chrisroos/Desktop/ing.html&quot;
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ok, this looks promising.  We can now proceed to the second security page.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let&amp;#8217;s use firefox to log in and get to the second security page again.  Fill in the details as requested, open live http headers and get hold of the data we are sending.  Right, so we &lt;span class=&quot;caps&quot;&gt;POST&lt;/span&gt; the following details to InitialINGDirect.html&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class=&quot;code&quot;&gt;
command=validateCustomer&amp;amp;locale=en_GB&amp;amp;device=web&amp;amp;PIN_A=5&amp;amp;PIN_B=1&amp;amp;PIN_C=4&amp;amp;DAYS=65&amp;amp;MONTHS=65&amp;amp;YEARS=66&amp;amp;GO.x=41&amp;amp;GO.y=9
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ah, so this looks interesting.  It seems that each key on the keypad is assigned a number (potentially different to the number displayed on the key).  It is that number that gets sent.  The numbers on the keypad appear in a random order, so I wonder if the same number is always assigned to the same key, or whether something else is required to tell the server the order of the keys.  Let&amp;#8217;s log in one more time and see if the results differ.  The assumption being that if they do then the server must know what order the keys have been displayed in.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bugger &amp;#8211; now it won&amp;#8217;t let me log in anymore (too many failed attempts) and I have to call the call centre.  Ooops.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Later&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Right, so it&amp;#8217;s now about 5 weeks after starting this investigation.  I&amp;#8217;m going to attempt to pick up where I left off and see if we can&amp;#8217;t get it finished.  Previously, before I got locked out of my account, I was going to test whether each digit on the keypad got assigned a different number each time.  In order to test, I logged into my account twice.  Each time, I saved the content of the page containing the keypad, and the output from Live Http Headers.  A quick examination of the differences between the output seems to suggest that we only ever send the position of a number on the keypad.  A made-up example might help to make this clear, starting with a keypad in no particular order.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class=&quot;code&quot;&gt;
5 1 2
4 7 3
0 8 9
  6
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If our pin number is 1234 and we are asked for the first digit then, although we would push the button labeled 1 on the keypad, we would actually send the value 2 to the server.  The buttons (but not the values they represent) all have a constant position, where the top-left button is position 1, the bottom-right is position 9 and the bottom button is position 0 (same layout as phone keypads).  For the above example, the button labeled 1 is in position 2, hence us sending a 2 to the server.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Right, so unless I&amp;#8217;m missing something, the server must &amp;#8216;know&amp;#8217; which three digits we&amp;#8217;re being asked for, along with the order of the keypad.  If we&amp;#8217;re to log in automatically then we&amp;#8217;re going to need to parse the text that asks us for certain digits and determine the order of the keypad.  A little experimentation with &lt;a href=&quot;http://code.whytheluckystiff.net/hpricot/&quot;&gt;hpricot&lt;/a&gt; yielded the following code.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class=&quot;code ruby&quot;&gt;
require &#39;rubygems&#39;
require &#39;hpricot&#39;

html = File.open(&#39;/Users/chrisroos/Desktop/ingdirect-b1.html&#39;) { |f| f.read }

# The request for our PIN digits appears within the following text
# &amp;lt;b&amp;gt;Using the Key Pad, please enter the 3rd, 5th and 2nd digits from your PIN&amp;lt;/b&amp;gt;
pin_a, pin_b, pin_c = html.scan(/Using the Key Pad, please enter the (\d).+?(\d).+?(\d).*?&amp;lt;\/b&amp;gt;/).flatten

# Ok, now let&#39;s find the order of the keypad (hey, it&#39;s in a div with id pin-pad - cool)
# This has turned out quite trivial.  The keypad is rendered within an html table, where each cell contains a button (input)
# that has a value of the number displayed on the button.  Hpricot makes it very easy to say &#39;get me all buttons (input)
# that appear in cells within the table that is in the div with an id of pin-pad&#39;.  As hpricot will parse the html table
# &#39;in order&#39;, i.e. from top-left to bottom right, we just have to append each button value into an array, preserving the
# order of the keypad.
doc = Hpricot(html)
keypad = (doc/&#39;div#pin-pad/table/tr/td/input&#39;).inject([]) { |array, btn| array &amp;lt;&amp;lt; btn.attributes[&#39;value&#39;].to_i; array }
# The last value read from the html keypad table will appear at index 9 (our array is 0 based), where we actually want it to
# appear at index 0 (keypad is in phone keypad order, i.e. 0 at bottom).  Luckily, we can just pop it off the end and
# prepend it to the array
keypad.unshift(keypad.pop)
# So, we can now convert a keypad like this
# 5 1 2
# 4 7 3
# 0 8 9
#   6
# into the equivalent ruby array [6, 5, 1, 2, 4, 7, 3, 0, 8, 9]
# We can then use Array#index to dive in grab the keypad position of a number
# keypad.index(5) #=&amp;gt; 1
# keypad.index(7) #=&amp;gt; 5
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Cool, so we should be able to string together what we have and automatically login to our account, we need to dip into ruby so that we might parse the keypad page using our code above.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Right, I&amp;#8217;ve cobbled the code together but instead of seeing an account overview page, I&amp;#8217;m actually receiving a page with more javascript relocation magic.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class=&quot;code javascript&quot;&gt;
&amp;lt;SCRIPT&amp;gt;
location.replace(&quot;/InitialINGDirect.html?command=displayLoggedOutError&amp;amp;locale=en_GB&amp;amp;device=web&quot;);
&amp;lt;/SCRIPT&amp;gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#8217;m wondering if I&amp;#8217;m missing some cookies &amp;#8211; maybe some more cookies get added to the jar on the keypad page.  Using the &lt;a href=&quot;https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/60&quot;&gt;web developer extension&lt;/a&gt; this is trivial to check.  Two cookies are set when we first visit the login page&amp;#8230;  Hmm, and there are still two when we get to the keypad page.  So something else is different.  Ok, so I found it.  Somehow, I&amp;#8217;d managed to miss out some data that was required for the login to work correctly.  I was not sending the command=validateCustomer key/pair even though I&amp;#8217;d already pasted it once above.  Oh well.  With this &amp;#8216;command&amp;#8217; added, we still get a page with some javascript relocation but this time we get relocated to the account summary..&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class=&quot;code javascript&quot;&gt;
&amp;lt;SCRIPT&amp;gt;
location.replace(&quot;/INGDirect.html?command=accountSummary&amp;amp;locale=en_GB&amp;amp;device=web&amp;amp;method=fetchClientAccountSummary&quot;);
&amp;lt;/SCRIPT&amp;gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If we finally &lt;span class=&quot;caps&quot;&gt;GET&lt;/span&gt; this page then we should be able to &amp;#8216;see&amp;#8217; our account overview on the command line.  Of course it wasn&amp;#8217;t that simple.  This just yields another javascript redirect.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class=&quot;code javascript&quot;&gt;
&amp;lt;SCRIPT&amp;gt;
location.replace(&quot;/INGDirect.html?command=displayClientAccountSummary&amp;amp;fill=1&quot;);
&amp;lt;/SCRIPT&amp;gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let&amp;#8217;s try to &lt;span class=&quot;caps&quot;&gt;GET&lt;/span&gt; this page then.  Woohoo, we&amp;#8217;re finally at the account overview page.  Wow that was hard work, so, so much harder than it should be for a web application.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The final step is to &lt;span class=&quot;caps&quot;&gt;GET&lt;/span&gt; and save the transaction page.  The url to the account page in the browser is:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;https://secure.ingdirect.co.uk/INGDirect.html?command=accountSummary&amp;amp;method=fetchClientAccountSummary&amp;amp;account=0&amp;amp;stepName=saving&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;GETting that url on the command line yields yet another javascript redirect (really, you do surprise me).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class=&quot;code javascript&quot;&gt;
&amp;lt;SCRIPT&amp;gt;
location.replace(&quot;/INGDirect.html?command=displayAccountDetails&quot;);
&amp;lt;/SCRIPT&amp;gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Fine, let&amp;#8217;s &lt;span class=&quot;caps&quot;&gt;GET&lt;/span&gt; that url then (starting to get bored now).  And, wait for it&amp;#8230;  Yeah, we have downloaded transactions.  Phew.  Right then, just a little code tidying and I&amp;#8217;ll get it uploaded to google code and this article can be posted.  Yay.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ok, so we&amp;#8217;re uploaded to &lt;a href=&quot;http://chrisroos.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/ing-direct&quot;&gt;google code&lt;/a&gt;.  Now to set this little fella free&amp;#8230;  An we&amp;#8217;re done.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

        <title>Automatically download egg credit card transactions</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#8217;ve followed in my &lt;a href=&quot;/blog/2007-05-14-automatically-downloading-my-recent-transactions-from-lloyds-tsb&quot;&gt;previous&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;/blog/2007-05-04-automatically-downloading-my-most-recent-hsbc-transactions&quot;&gt;footsteps&lt;/a&gt; and automated the download of my &lt;a href=&quot;http://egg.com&quot;&gt;egg&lt;/a&gt; credit card transactions and statements.  Using this in combination with my &lt;a href=&quot;/blog/2007-04-01-converting-egg-credit-card-statements-to-ofx-for-upload-to-wesabe&quot;&gt;ofx convertor&lt;/a&gt; makes it easier for me to upload my financial data to &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.wesabe.com&quot;&gt;wesabe&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

# There is no sensible way to get your statements.  I&#39;d hope for something like /statements/18-jun-2007.html but no such luck

# Interestingly, this is how it works from the recent transactions page, from any actual statement page, it appears that this is

        <title>I really don't know whether this is spam or not...</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#8217;ve received another innocent looking comment, &amp;#8220;Hey man, thanks for article!&amp;#8221;, this time from gribitonline.com.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I followed the same procedure as &lt;a href=&quot;/blog/2007-06-06-a-little-further-investigation-into-those-pesky-scammers&quot;&gt;last time&lt;/a&gt;  and found that this site contains  the same style porn links at the bottom of the page.  The site looks more genuine than all the others, hence the title &amp;#8211; I&amp;#8217;m really not sure whether this is intentional spam or whether it&amp;#8217;s been hijacked.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I did some investigation to see if I could find the provider of the porn links.  Unfortunately I&amp;#8217;ve not found anything obvious, although I have noticed some patterns.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;The porn links are embedded within the body of the page and then moved to the bottom with the help of javascript.  I assume that this is an &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.wikipedia.org/wiki/SEO&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;caps&quot;&gt;SEO&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt; trick, based on the understanding that links in content are granted higher ratings than links just for navigation.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Site without javascript enabled&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://farm2.static.flickr.com/1208/544423293_cdf567e9a2_o.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Site with javascript enabled&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://farm2.static.flickr.com/1040/544325496_41bc3cb742_o.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;The javascript used to move the links always looks like this.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;pre class=&quot;code javascript&quot;&gt;
var el, el2;
el = document.getElementById(&#39;cbceddfd&#39;);
el2 = document.getElementById(&#39;cceedfda&#39;);
if (el &amp;amp;&amp;amp; el2)
el2.appendChild(el);
el = document.getElementById(&#39;bfabedba&#39;);
el2 = // ... and repeat
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Each link is inserted into its own empty span at the bottom of the page.  The spans seem to have the same ids on each of the sites that have these type of links.  The first span is always cceedfda, the second is cecfaabe, with subsequent ids also being the same across different sites.  There doesn&amp;#8217;t appear to be any other pattern to the ids.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Sites from previous experiment that follow this pattern
	&lt;ul&gt;
		&lt;li&gt;timesofsooz.com&lt;/li&gt;
		&lt;li&gt;pinkyspaperhause.com&lt;/li&gt;
		&lt;li&gt;moradblog.com&lt;/li&gt;
		&lt;li&gt;fromgreghead.com&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;I&amp;#8217;m really quite intrigued by these sites.  Sad, I know.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;</description>

        <title>Steel mounted photographic wall prints (or, cool pictures printed on metal) in Thanet</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.printeriordesign.co.uk&quot;&gt;Printerior Design&lt;/a&gt; are a &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thanet&quot;&gt;local&lt;/a&gt; (to me, probably not to you) firm that produce cool pictures.  They are beautiful &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.printeriordesign.co.uk/galleries.html&quot;&gt;photos&lt;/a&gt; printed directly onto heavy duty metal &amp;#8211; &amp;#8216;man-art&amp;#8217; if you will.  I bought &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.printeriordesign.co.uk/landscapes/pages/Dawn%201500%20thumbnail%20with%20drop%20shadow_jpg.htm&quot;&gt;this one&lt;/a&gt; as a Christmas present.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.printeriordesign.co.uk/landscapes/pages/Dawn%201500%20thumbnail%20with%20drop%20shadow_jpg.htm&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://farm2.static.flickr.com/1239/534275282_2d4ba6dde1.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The reason for this post is because a friend recently asked me where I got the picture.  Not remembering the name of the company, I started googling.  I knew that they had pictures in Harpers Wine Bar (I thought they had a website but I can&amp;#8217;t find it) in &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Broadstairs&quot;&gt;Broadstairs&lt;/a&gt;, and in the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.albionbroadstairs.co.uk/&quot;&gt;Albion Hotel&lt;/a&gt;, also in Broadstairs.  I also knew that their workshop was on Pysons Road Industrial estate.  Sadly, even with this info, they just weren&amp;#8217;t appearing in google.  So, I&amp;#8217;m hoping that this might help them out a little bit.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I can&amp;#8217;t help but think that they&amp;#8217;d benefit massively from a blog about their work &amp;#8211; I&amp;#8217;m of the belief that what they do is pretty different.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Update&lt;/strong&gt; I&amp;#8217;ve uploaded a copy of the picture I have to &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.flickr.com&quot;&gt;flickr&lt;/a&gt; and embedded it in this post &amp;#8211; hoping the printerior guys don&amp;#8217;t mind too much&amp;#8230;&lt;/p&gt;</description>

        <title>Reevoo.com and Seo</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.reevoo.com&quot;&gt;We&lt;/a&gt; had an &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Search_engine_optimization&quot;&gt;Seo&lt;/a&gt; consultant in yesterday.  Although a lot of what was suggested was common sense there were a few interesting snippets of information.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Seo is only just starting to become a viable marketing option in the Uk.  Are we really that far behind the states?&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Google are working really hard on getting their bots to &amp;#8216;see&amp;#8217; the page exactly the same as a user.  This allows them to give a higher rating to content appearing in the top left hand corner of the page (the bit a user looks at first), regardless of where it is in the document.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Google accounts for about 97% of search in the Uk, so although we talk about search engine optimisation, we really mean google optimisation.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.sitemaps.org&quot;&gt;Xml sitemaps&lt;/a&gt; have little or no effect.  The majority of reevoo.com may soon be made up of pages with little or no review content.  The suggestion is that we keep these pages hidden from google, but by using &lt;a href=&quot;http://microformats.org/wiki/rel-nofollow&quot;&gt;rel=&amp;#8216;nofollow&amp;#8217;&lt;/a&gt; when linking to these pages from within the site, not by removing them from the sitemap.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Having an unbalanced number of links-out vs links-in is bad.  This is related to the above point.  The reason we may well end up with lots of pages with little content is that we have a relatively long lead time between a product being released and us collecting reviews for it.  We would like to be able to present some useful info for these products even if we don&amp;#8217;t have reviews &amp;#8211; links to relevant material elsewhere on the net seems like one way of reaching that goal.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Google still recognises dial-up as the lowest common denominator when taking into account page download size and time.  It was suggested that each page be no larger than 100KB.  Hmm, &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.prototypejs.org&quot;&gt;prototype&lt;/a&gt; alone seems to weigh in at around 97KB, and we are sending 225KB of javascript for any given product page (&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.reevoo.com/reviews/mpn/nikon/d70&quot;&gt;example&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Title attributes on anchors carry a lot of weighting.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Links in content are more valuable than a bunch of stand-alone links.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;People aren&amp;#8217;t particular interested in searching/filtering by price.  Really?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A lot of the advice boils down to having a site that people actually find useful.  I think that if we can work on that in combination with the basic principles of well formed documents, clean separation of &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CSS&quot;&gt;presentation&lt;/a&gt; from content and of &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unobtrusive_JavaScript&quot;&gt;behaviour from markup&lt;/a&gt;, we&amp;#8217;ll have a solid base on which to apply the tips above.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Oh, and the reason for the Seo chap coming in was in an attempt to find out why we fell off the google radar a few months back.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

        <title>A little further investigation into those pesky scammers</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;I &lt;a href=&quot;/blog/2007-05-17-pesky-scammers&quot;&gt;wrote&lt;/a&gt; a short while ago about receiving comments that were not obviously spam.  In the few weeks  between that post and this, I&amp;#8217;ve received several more legitimate looking comments.  Tonight, I finally looked in some detail at the comments I&amp;#8217;d received.  The comments were either very generic (&amp;#8216;nice post&amp;#8217; or &amp;#8216;thanks for the info&amp;#8217;) or were copied from previous comments on the site.  The &amp;#8216;homepages&amp;#8217; came in four different flavours.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Look like legitimate blogs but contain hidden content and porn links at the bottom of the page.&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;moradblog.com&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;fromgreghead.com&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Crappy web shops.  These only really caught my attention because they all look identical.&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;camikon.com&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;leaderdvd.com&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;pet-supplies-store.info&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Look like legitimate blogs but are noticeable due to a complete lack of style and porn links at the bottom of the page.&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;pinkyspaperhause.com&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;timesofsooz.com&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Look like legitimate websites but a &lt;code&gt;site:&amp;lt;website&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt; search in google reveals lots of porn pages.&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;smachex.info&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;wampy.info&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;www.valmux.com&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Oh, there is also one other site that I really cannot decide whether to classify as spam or not &amp;#8211; ireadnews.net (sorry if you&amp;#8217;re not spam).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The addresses are here (and not linked to) for the benefit of anyone that happens to stumble across this page.  I&amp;#8217;m actually quite amazed at the depth of some of these sites.  moradblog.com in particular has links to lots of &amp;#8216;web 2.0&amp;#8217; sites for &amp;#8216;morad&amp;#8217; (flickr, del.icio.us etc).  It makes me half wonder if they are actual spam sites or whether the site has been hijacked in some way..&lt;/p&gt;</description>

        <title>Ranting about Sky</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;I have three minor outstanding issues with a recent sky installation.  Not wanting to phone them (as previous experience suggests that it&amp;#8217;s going to waste a lot of my life) I thought I&amp;#8217;d drop them an email.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.flickr.com/photos/chrisjroos/532292949/&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://farm2.static.flickr.com/1324/532292949_c503f0b1db.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Uh oh.  Looks like they don&amp;#8217;t want my email.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;#8220;The highlighted field above has an invalid value.  Please correct it.&lt;br /&gt;
Please make sure that no more than 500 characters have been entered in this field.&amp;#8221;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So now, not only have I wasted time waiting for their website to time out while signing up, but I&amp;#8217;ve also wasted time filling in a useless feedback form, taking a screenshot and even blogging about it.  Oh, and I&amp;#8217;m still going to have to speak to someone.  Brilliant.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

        <title>An open letter to my local newspapers</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;I just sent this email to the editors of four local papers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hi,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#8217;m emailing you as representatives of (what I believe to be) the four main newspapers in Thanet.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;KM Extra&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Thanet Adscene&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Isle of Thanet Gazette&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Thanet Times&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On the off chance you&amp;#8217;re already bored or have filed me to spam (please don&amp;#8217;t), a quick summary is that I&amp;#8217;m offering to do some work, for free, that might help foster discussion around your newspaper content.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#8217;d love it if all of your newspaper content was on-line.  I realise that both kentonline.co.uk and ickent.co.uk already exist and carry &lt;strong&gt;some&lt;/strong&gt; of the content from your papers.  I also realise that it may not be commercially wise to publish all newspaper content on-line.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, I&amp;#8217;ve come up with a very cunning (it&amp;#8217;s not that cunning) plan.  I&amp;#8217;m thinking of creating a blog-type site, where each post will represent a newspaper story.  I propose that the title of the blog post will be the title of the article in the paper, and that the body of the blog post will be left blank.  My intention is that people that buy/receive any of the above papers can use the permalink of the blog post as a central discussion point.  They can either comment right there on the blog or they can ping/trackback to the post from their own blogs.  The best thing that could happen is that other people stumble across these conversations and want to get involved, at which point they have to go buy a copy of the paper to get the original content.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#8217;m planning on doing this stuff anyway, but I wanted to give you guys a heads up.  I figure that this mail will either a) land in spamland, b) be received with a negative response, or c) be received with a positive response.  Oh, or d) received and ignored.  Pretty much covered all bases there haven&amp;#8217;t I?  Anyhoo, I&amp;#8217;d love to hear any thoughts you have, especially if they are strongly for or against the idea.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This letter will be posted to my blog&lt;sup class=&quot;footnote&quot; id=&quot;fnr1&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn1&quot;&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; shortly.  On the off chance you&amp;#8217;ve read this far and feel like replying, I&amp;#8217;d like to post them to my blog too, but that&amp;#8217;s completely up to you.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To summarize.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;I&amp;#8217;d like to converse with other people that have read the same article that I have.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;The only content from your newspapers that will appear on-line is the heading of each article.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;I&amp;#8217;m offering to do all the work.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;I&amp;#8217;ll host the site and transcribe each article from each of the four weekly papers.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;The site won&amp;#8217;t have advertising.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Anyone can comment on the site.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Anyone can trackback/pingback to the site.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;I can&amp;#8217;t promise that I&amp;#8217;ll keep up the work forever.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;All the content of the site will be available to anyone that wants it &amp;#8211; probably under a creative commons license or something similar.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;I have no intention of making money from this.  In fact, I&amp;#8217;m willing to pay money to make it happen.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Cheers,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Chris&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>I wanna be cool too</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;Err, right.  Anyhoo, I&amp;#8217;ve started using &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.tumblr.com&quot;&gt;tumblr&lt;/a&gt; to aggregate (currently) my &lt;a href=&quot;http://flickr.com/photos/chrisjroos&quot;&gt;flickr&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;http://twitter.com/chrisroos&quot;&gt;twitter&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;http://del.icio.us/chrisjroos&quot;&gt;del.icio.us&lt;/a&gt; feeds.  What&amp;#8217;s that you say, &amp;#8220;where is it?&amp;#8221;, why, it&amp;#8217;s right &lt;a href=&quot;http://life.chrisroos.co.uk&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt; of course.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

        <title>Pesky Scammers</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;A couple of days ago, I received a comment to one of my articles.  &amp;#8220;Hmm, that looks familiar I thought&amp;#8221;, and not without good reason.  You see, the comment had been copied verbatim from another comment on the same article.  The only change was the author&amp;#8217;s name and the url of their &amp;#8216;homepage&amp;#8217;.  After a little deliberation I deleted the comment.  I found it interesting for two reasons.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;The &amp;#8216;homepage&amp;#8217; link wasn&amp;#8217;t obviously spam (it was some kind of kitchen site I believe), although a quick search did reveal it on some blacklists.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;I am unable to teach &lt;a href=&quot;http://akismet.com/&quot;&gt;akismet&lt;/a&gt; (my current form of spam protection) to recognise these types of messages as spam, after all, the content itself is perfectly valid.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Anyway, I got on with my life until, whoah, it happened again this morning.  Same article but a different comment had been copied.  The mystery continues&amp;#8230; (at least, until I forget about it again).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Anyone else experienced this?&lt;/p&gt;</description>

        <title>Automatically downloading my recent transactions from Lloyds Tsb</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;In my continuing quest to cut down my use of banking websites (and increase my use of &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.wesabe.com&quot;&gt;wesabe&lt;/a&gt;), I&amp;#8217;ve hacked together a script to download my recent transactions from &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.lloydstsb.com&quot;&gt;Lloyds Tsb&lt;/a&gt;.  Sadly, the transactions are in &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/QIF&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;caps&quot;&gt;QIF&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt; format, as only &lt;span class=&quot;caps&quot;&gt;QIF&lt;/span&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comma-separated_values&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;caps&quot;&gt;CSV&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt; formats are offered.  Maybe I&amp;#8217;ll get round to exporting the data in &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.ofx.net&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;caps&quot;&gt;OFX&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt; format sometime in the future.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Automatically downloading my most recent Hsbc transactions</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#8217;ve updated my &lt;a href=&quot;/blog/2006-12-24-curl-is-fast-becoming-my-favourite-toy&quot;&gt;previous&lt;/a&gt; curl/ruby script to automatically download my most recent transactions from Hsbc.  I created the original script as I had a couple of hours spare and wanted to see if I could do it.  The update has been driven by my continued use of &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.wesabe.com&quot;&gt;wesabe&lt;/a&gt;.  Not only does it make my life a bit easier (which is, after all, the point of software) but the wesabe guys have suggested that they may be able to roll it into their client.  Cool.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As an aside.  It really, really, really shouldn&amp;#8217;t be as hard as it is to automatically get a downloaded list of my transactions.  At least Hsbc offer transactions in &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.ofx.net&quot;&gt;ofx&lt;/a&gt; format, unlike &lt;a href=&quot;/blog/2007-04-01-converting-egg-credit-card-statements-to-ofx-for-upload-to-wesabe&quot;&gt;egg&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;http://chrisroos.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/egg-ofx/ing_direct&quot;&gt;ing direct&lt;/a&gt;.  Come on, The Banks, sort it out eh.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

        <title>Tonic Systems TonicPoint free Powerpoint viewer</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;I had need to view a powerpoint presentation on my Mac.  In the past, I&amp;#8217;ve uploaded them to &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.slideshare.net&quot;&gt;slideshare&lt;/a&gt;, but that wasn&amp;#8217;t suitable in this instance.  A quick google reveals some free java software by tonic systems.  Unfortunately (well, fortunately for tonic systems), they&amp;#8217;ve been &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.tonicsystems.com/&quot;&gt;bought&lt;/a&gt; by google and the link to their software has disappeared.  Luckily, the google cache has a copy of the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.google.co.uk/search?q=cache:4BswR-sgicYJ:www.tonicsystems.com/products/viewer/+tonicsystems+java+viewer&amp;amp;hl=en&amp;amp;ct=clnk&amp;amp;cd=1&amp;amp;gl=uk&quot;&gt;original page&lt;/a&gt; with a &lt;a href=&quot;http://downloads.tonicsystems.com/viewer/TonicPointViewer-1.4-OSX.zip&quot;&gt;working link&lt;/a&gt; to the download.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This probably won&amp;#8217;t remain relevant very long, what with the recent &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.techcrunch.com/2007/04/17/googles-office-suite-complete-google-powerpoint-confirmed/&quot;&gt;news&lt;/a&gt; of google adding a powerpoint clone to their office suite.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

        <title>ebay feedback</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;This is a pathetic moan about something that is really not important at all.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I bought an &lt;a href=&quot;http://cgi.ebay.co.uk/ws/eBayISAPI.dll?ViewItem&amp;amp;ih=014&amp;amp;sspagename=STRK%3AMEWN%3AIT&amp;amp;viewitem=&amp;amp;item=330105019114&amp;amp;rd=1&amp;amp;rd=1&quot;&gt;Apple mini &lt;span class=&quot;caps&quot;&gt;DVI&lt;/span&gt; to &lt;span class=&quot;caps&quot;&gt;VGA&lt;/span&gt; adapter&lt;/a&gt; from someone on &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.ebay.co.uk&quot;&gt;ebay&lt;/a&gt;.  For various reasons, I was unable to test the adapter until yesterday (Fri 13th Apr), two weeks after the purchase.  That didn&amp;#8217;t stop the seller emailing me a week ago, suggesting that I leave feedback before they do.  That&amp;#8217;s pathetic &amp;#8211; feedback should be left for me based on the speed of my purchase alone, which was immediate.  What the seller is actually saying in that email is that if I decide to leave them bad feedback then they&amp;#8217;ll probably do the same to me out of retaliation.  Grow up eh.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The adapter actually works great, and I&amp;#8217;ve now left the seller positive feedback.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

        <title>Small, specific mongrel web servers</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#8217;ve created a simple &lt;a href=&quot;http://mongrel.rubyforge.org/&quot;&gt;mongrel&lt;/a&gt; server that allows you to upload text files for subsequent deletion and retrieval.  If it sounds pretty pointless, that&amp;#8217;s because it is&amp;#8230;currently.  I wonder though, if the basic premise couldn&amp;#8217;t be used to create some text-transformation tools.  I&amp;#8217;m thinking of really simple tools that might spell-check a text file, or convert text from &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.textism.com/tools/textile/&quot;&gt;textile&lt;/a&gt; to html.  My end goal would be to have lots of super simple tools that I can chain together to use as a blogging platform, removing my current dependence on &lt;a href=&quot;http://trac.typosphere.org/&quot;&gt;typo&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#8217;ve made the &lt;a href=&quot;http://chrisroos.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/text_file_server/server.rb&quot;&gt;server&lt;/a&gt; slightly more complex than it needs to be by imposing some artificial constraints (&lt;a href=&quot;http://chrisroos.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/text_file_server/server-test.rb&quot;&gt;examples&lt;/a&gt;).  The basic premise is that you &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.w3.org/Protocols/rfc2616/rfc2616-sec9.html#sec9.5&quot;&gt;post&lt;/a&gt; a text file, between 1 and 5000 bytes in size, with a &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.w3.org/Protocols/rfc2616/rfc2616-sec14.html#sec14.17&quot;&gt;content-type&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.iana.org/assignments/media-types/text/&quot;&gt;plain/text&lt;/a&gt;.  All being well, the server responds with &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.w3.org/Protocols/rfc2616/rfc2616-sec10.html#sec10.2.2&quot;&gt;201 Created&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.w3.org/Protocols/rfc2616/rfc2616-sec14.html#sec14.30&quot;&gt;location&lt;/a&gt; of the new resource.  The resource is actually retrieved by &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.w3.org/Protocols/rfc2616/rfc2616-sec9.html#sec9.7&quot;&gt;deleting&lt;/a&gt; it &amp;#8211; the contents of the file are returned in the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.w3.org/Protocols/rfc2616/rfc2616-sec4.html#sec4.3&quot;&gt;body&lt;/a&gt; with a &amp;#8220;200 OK&amp;#8221; response.  I&amp;#8217;ve tried to use the relevant &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.w3.org/Protocols/rfc2616/rfc2616-sec10.html#sec10.4&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;caps&quot;&gt;HTTP&lt;/span&gt; error&lt;/a&gt; when resource creation fails.  The whole &amp;#8216;post&amp;#8217; and &amp;#8216;delete&amp;#8217; pattern for these transformations feels kinda &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Representational_State_Transfer&quot;&gt;restful&lt;/a&gt;, but I may be way off the mark.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#8217;m wondering how much of &lt;a href=&quot;http://pipes.yahoo.com/pipes/&quot;&gt;yahoo pipes&lt;/a&gt; could be replicated with lots of small, specific web servers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Anyone have any thoughts on any of this?&lt;/p&gt;</description>

        <title>Getting to grips with pwdhash</title>
        <description>&lt;h2&gt;Overview&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Having used &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.pwdhash.com&quot;&gt;pwdhash&lt;/a&gt; for a while, I decided it was about time I dived into the implementation to see what was actually going on.  I figured that the best way for me to get an understanding of the library was to translate it from &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Javascript&quot;&gt;javascript&lt;/a&gt; to &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.ruby-lang.org&quot;&gt;ruby&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Investigating the javascript libraries&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The first step was to create a basic environment within which I could explore the existing javascript functionality.  Relying on &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.getfirebug.com/&quot;&gt;Firebug&lt;/a&gt; to provide a javascript console, this was as simple as creating a very basic html page.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class=&quot;code html&quot;&gt;
&amp;lt;html&amp;gt;
  &amp;lt;head&amp;gt;
    &amp;lt;script type=&quot;text/javascript&quot; src=&quot;md5.js&quot; /&amp;gt;
    &amp;lt;script type=&quot;text/javascript&quot; src=&quot;hashed-password.js&quot; /&amp;gt;
    &amp;lt;title&amp;gt;pwdhash client&amp;lt;/title&amp;gt;
  &amp;lt;/head&amp;gt;
  &amp;lt;body&amp;gt;
  &amp;lt;/body&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;/html&amp;gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It actually took me a good few minutes to get up and running with this environment.  It seems that &lt;a href=&quot;http://crypto.stanford.edu/PwdHash/RemotePwdHash/hashed-password.js&quot;&gt;hashed-password.js&lt;/a&gt; relies on a variable, SPH_kPasswordPrefix, being defined.  Although defined in &lt;a href=&quot;http://crypto.stanford.edu/PwdHash/RemotePwdHash/pwdhash.js&quot;&gt;pwdhash.js&lt;/a&gt;, it turns out to be our only dependency on that file.  In wanting to keep the environment as simple as possible, I chose to copy the definition of that variable to hashed-password.js, allowing us to remain independent of pwdhash.js.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Starting to implement the javascript functions in ruby&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Knowing that &lt;a href=&quot;http://pajhome.org.uk/crypt/md5/md5src.html&quot;&gt;md5.js&lt;/a&gt; implemented pretty standard &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Md5&quot;&gt;md5&lt;/a&gt; (&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.faqs.org/rfcs/rfc1321.html&quot;&gt;rfc&lt;/a&gt;) and &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hmac&quot;&gt;hmac&lt;/a&gt; (&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.faqs.org/rfcs/rfc2104.html&quot;&gt;rfc&lt;/a&gt;) routines, for which there are equivalents in ruby, I chose to concentrate on translating hashed-password.js.  Although the code is pretty simple, it took me a while to understand because of my limited javascript knowledge.  We essentially construct an object (SPH_HashedPassword), supplying it with password and realm (domain), that generates, and represents, the hashed password.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The very first thing that a newly created SPH_HashedPassword does, is to use the b64_hmac_md5 function, supplied in the md5.js library, to generate the initial hash.  I really didn&amp;#8217;t expect to be tripped up quite this early on, but I just couldn&amp;#8217;t replicate the value obtained from b64_hmac_md5 (using &lt;a href=&quot;http://ruby-doc.org/stdlib/libdoc/digest/rdoc/index.html&quot;&gt;digest/md5&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;http://deisui.org/~ueno/ruby/hmac.html&quot;&gt;ruby-hmac&lt;/a&gt;.)  I now realise that I didn&amp;#8217;t fully understand what I was actually trying to replicate &amp;#8211; I really should have paid more attention to those three little letters (b64 / &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.faqs.org/rfcs/rfc3548.html&quot;&gt;base64&lt;/a&gt;) at the beginning of the function name&amp;#8230;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Back to the drawing-board &amp;#8211; starting to implement the md5.js library in ruby&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Without thinking about it as much as I should have, I decided that maybe I needed to implement the functionality provided in md5.js in ruby (&lt;a href=&quot;http://chrisroos.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/pwdhash-rb/md5-rb/md5.rb&quot;&gt;code&lt;/a&gt; for reference).  I dived in and started replicating one function at a time.  All was going OK until I came across the &lt;a href=&quot;http://developer.mozilla.org/en/docs/Core_JavaScript_1.5_Guide:Operators:Bitwise_Operators#Bitwise_Shift_Operators&quot;&gt;zero fill right shift&lt;/a&gt; bitwise operator in javascript.  There is no standard equivalent in ruby, but a little help from the &lt;a href=&quot;http://blade.nagaokaut.ac.jp/cgi-bin/scat.rb/ruby/ruby-talk/144877&quot;&gt;mailing list&lt;/a&gt; allowed me to come up with this implementation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class=&quot;code ruby&quot;&gt;
class Integer
  def zero_fill_right_shift(count)
    (self &amp;gt;&amp;gt; count) &amp;amp; ((2 ** (size_in_bits-count))-1) # defined in Integer, size_in_bits is self.size * 8
  end
end
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Although this allowed me to move a little further, progress completely ground to a halt when trying to replicate the bit_rol function.  It seems that bitwise left-shifting by a negative number offers a different result in javascript and ruby.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class=&quot;code&quot;&gt;
javascript: 1 &amp;lt;&amp;lt; -1 = -2147483648
ruby: 1 &amp;lt;&amp;lt; -1 = 0
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Back to the drawing-board (again) &amp;#8211; using digest/md5 and ruby-hmac to replicate the results given by md5.js&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This time, I decided to break the b64_hmac_md5 function down into its component parts and see which, if any, differed between ruby and javascript.  The first step was to compare the hex output of a simple md5 of a string.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class=&quot;code&quot;&gt;
javascript: hex_md5(text) =&amp;gt; &quot;1cb251ec0d568de6a929b520c4aed8d1&quot;
ruby: Digest::MD5.new(text).hexdigest =&amp;gt; 1cb251ec0d568de6a929b520c4aed8d1
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Next up was a comparison of an &lt;span class=&quot;caps&quot;&gt;HMAC&lt;/span&gt; MD5 of a key and some data.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class=&quot;code&quot;&gt;
javascript: hex_hmac_md5(key, data) =&amp;gt; &quot;9d5c73ef85594d34ec4438b7c97e51d8&quot;
ruby: HMAC::MD5.hexdigest(key, data) =&amp;gt; &quot;9d5c73ef85594d34ec4438b7c97e51d8&quot;
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Although we can easily replicate the result of hex_hmac_md5 in ruby, we actually want to replicate the result of b64_hmac_md5 (i.e. the hashed data encoded in base64 representation.)&lt;br /&gt;
With a bit of thinking, and some trial and error, I realised that I needed to calculate the binary digest of the key and data, and then base64 encode the result.  &lt;strong&gt;Note&lt;/strong&gt;.  My original problems arose when comparing the output of the binary string data, what with Javascript being able to display unicode characters and ruby just displaying their code points in octal representation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class=&quot;code&quot;&gt;
javascript: b64_hmac_md5(key, data) =&amp;gt; &quot;nVxz74VZTTTsRDi3yX5R2A&quot;
ruby: # This requires both ruby-hmac and base64
ruby: Base64.encode64(HMAC::MD5.digest(key, data)) =&amp;gt; &quot;nVxz74VZTTTsRDi3yX5R2A==&quot;
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is the first time we see any difference in the values obtained from javascript and ruby.  It turns out that there&amp;#8217;s a clue to this difference in the md5.js library:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class=&quot;code javascript&quot;&gt;
var b64pad  = &quot;&quot;; /* base-64 pad character. &quot;=&quot; for strict RFC compliance   */
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ok, so it seems I should just be able to remove the pad characters (=) from my generated hash and I&amp;#8217;ll achieve the same value.  Happy that this was a pretty easy difference to resolve, I could move forward with actually implementing the pwdhash magic in ruby&amp;#8230;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Implementing the pwdhash magic in ruby&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The pwdhash specific stuff is actually very simple.  It alters the initial base 64 encoded hash to ensure that we have:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;One upper case char&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;One lower case char&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;One non alpha-numeric char&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;One number&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, having got over the first hurdle, the remainder of the translation was pretty simple.  In fact, in its current &lt;a href=&quot;http://chrisroos.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/pwdhash-rb/pwdhash.rb&quot;&gt;incarnation&lt;/a&gt; (revision 62), there are only a few small syntactical differences between the javascript and ruby versions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Next steps&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Rubify the code.  Although I&amp;#8217;ve copied it almost directly from the javascript I think I&amp;#8217;ve actually managed to make it slightly less readable.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Investigate the whole world of &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.unicode.org&quot;&gt;unicode&lt;/a&gt; a bit more &amp;#8211; I definitely don&amp;#8217;t know as much about it as I should.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

        <title>I want fast trains</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Update Tue Apr 10th&lt;/strong&gt; Maybe &lt;a href=&quot;http://maps.google.com/help/maps/userguide/index.html&quot;&gt;google&lt;/a&gt; read my question.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href=&quot;http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/europe/6521295.stm&quot;&gt;news&lt;/a&gt; of the very, very, very fast train in France made me wonder how one of my &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.wayfaring.com/maps/show/35440&quot;&gt;regular routes&lt;/a&gt; compared.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;%iframe{ :src =&amp;gt; &amp;#8220;http://www.wayfaring.com/maps/export/35440&amp;#8221;, :scrolling =&amp;gt; &amp;#8220;no&amp;#8221;, :frameborder =&amp;gt; &amp;#8220;0&amp;#8221;, :style =&amp;gt; &amp;#8220;width:400px;height:250px;border:2px solid #cccccc;&amp;#8221;}&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At the time I travel, the journey takes 2 hours 10 minutes.  So, 130 minutes to travel 84 miles.  That&amp;#8217;ll be about 38 miles an hour then.  Brilliant.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Actually, does anyone know of any sites (like wayfaring) where I might plot some points on a map and get either a &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.georss.org/&quot;&gt;georss&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=&quot;http://earth.google.com/kml/&quot;&gt;kml&lt;/a&gt; feed of the data?  I like &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.wayfaring.com&quot;&gt;wayfaring&lt;/a&gt; an&amp;#8217; all, but it&amp;#8217;d be nice to be able to separate the route data from their site.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

        <title>Obtaining latitude/longitude for UK postcodes</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;It turns out that we can use &lt;a href=&quot;http://streetmap.co.uk&quot;&gt;streetmap.co.uk&lt;/a&gt; to &lt;a href=&quot;http://streetmap.co.uk/streetmap.dll?GridConvert&quot;&gt;convert&lt;/a&gt; a UK postcode to latitude/longitude.  It also turns out that a combination of &lt;a href=&quot;http://curl.haxx.se/&quot;&gt;curl&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.ruby-lang.org&quot;&gt;ruby&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;http://code.whytheluckystiff.net/hpricot/&quot;&gt;hpricot&lt;/a&gt; make it very easy to bypass the streetmap site to perform the conversion.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class=&quot;code ruby&quot;&gt;
postcode = &#39;SW1A 2AJ&#39;

html = `curl &quot;http://streetmap.co.uk/streetmap.dll&quot; -d&quot;MfcISAPICommand=GridConvert&quot; -d&quot;name=#{postcode}&quot; -d&quot;type=PostCode&quot;`

require &#39;rubygems&#39;
require &#39;hpricot&#39;

doc = Hpricot(html)

latitude, longitude = 0, 0

(doc/&quot;div&quot;/&quot;center&quot;/&quot;table&quot;/&quot;tr&quot;).each do |row|
  attribute = (row/&quot;td&quot;).first.inner_text
  value = (row/&quot;td&quot;).last.inner_text
  if attribute =~ /lat/i
    latitude = Float(value[/\((.*)\)/, 1])
  elsif attribute =~ /long/i
    longitude = Float(value[/\((.*)\)/, 1])
  end
end

p [latitude, longitude]
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Err, this is probably a bit naughty.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

        <title>Converting Egg Credit Card Statements to Ofx (for upload to wesabe)</title>
        <description>&lt;div class=&quot;notice&quot;&gt;17th Nov 2009. I&amp;#8217;ve finally got around to updating this utility.  See &lt;a href=&quot;/blog/2009-11-17-converting-egg-statements-and-transactions-to-ofx&quot;&gt;this later post&lt;/a&gt; for more details.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#8217;ve cobbled together some pretty nasty code to convert an &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.egg.com&quot;&gt;Egg&lt;/a&gt; Credit Card statement to &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.ofx.net&quot;&gt;Ofx&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Grab the &lt;a href=&quot;http://chrisroos.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/egg-ofx/&quot;&gt;source&lt;/a&gt; from &lt;a href=&quot;http://code.google.com&quot;&gt;google code&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class=&quot;code shell&quot;&gt;
$ svn checkout http://chrisroos.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/egg-ofx
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As well as requiring &lt;a href=&quot;http://code.whytheluckystiff.net/hpricot/&quot;&gt;hpricot&lt;/a&gt;, you will need to edit the StatementsFolder and OfxOutputFolder variables in egg.rb.  These need to point to a directory containing html statements, and an empty output directory respectively.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#8217;ve used the script to upload my last 12 statements to &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.wesabe.com&quot;&gt;wesabe&lt;/a&gt; and everything seems to work Ok. If you have any questions, just post a comment here.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

        <description>&lt;p&gt;This &lt;a href=&quot;http://chrisroos.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/plugins/routing_redirection/&quot;&gt;plugin&lt;/a&gt; offers the following two features.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Repairing an Hp Pavilion N5241 laptop</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;A mate&amp;#8217;s laptop was making very strange noises.  I wondered if dust could be causing the &amp;#8216;interference&amp;#8217; and so took the laptop apart to clean.  Although it didn&amp;#8217;t look too dirty, it seems to have done the trick.  Photos of the re-assembly are on &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.flickr.com/photos/chrisjroos/sets/72157600007191066/&quot;&gt;flickr&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

        <title>Frustrating user experience with Hsbc online banking</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Update &amp;#8211; 9th Jan 2013&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
I received an email toward the end of last (thanks, Nick) pointing out that when you choose a payee from the list of beneficiaries (e.g. &lt;span class=&quot;caps&quot;&gt;HMRC&lt;/span&gt; SA AS &lt;span class=&quot;caps&quot;&gt;SHIP&lt;/span&gt;) you&amp;#8217;ll be presented with their sort code and account number on the next screen. If it doesn&amp;#8217;t match what you&amp;#8217;re expecting you can go back and choose another entry from the list.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Update &amp;#8211; 15th Feb 2012&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
I&amp;#8217;ve removed the table of sort codes and account numbers that used to live at the bottom of this page.  I received an email from someone (thanks, Adam) that had found this page and realised that at least one of the entries in the table was incorrect (the one for &lt;span class=&quot;caps&quot;&gt;HMRC&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;caps&quot;&gt;SELF&lt;/span&gt; AS &lt;span class=&quot;caps&quot;&gt;CUMB&lt;/span&gt;).  I don&amp;#8217;t want to host incorrect information but also don&amp;#8217;t want to maintain the table so the easiest thing for me is to remove it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#8217;ve also just had a quick play with attempting to pay a &lt;span class=&quot;caps&quot;&gt;HMRC&lt;/span&gt; bill using the &lt;span class=&quot;caps&quot;&gt;HSBC&lt;/span&gt; friends and family mechanism.  It looks like the error message is at least a little clearer now, beginning, &amp;#8220;Sorry, the details you have entered match a beneficiary on our pay a bill or organisation list.&amp;#8221;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Update &amp;#8211; 27th Feb 2010&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
I&amp;#8217;ve updated the table of sort codes and account numbers based on comments (via disqus) and emails I&amp;#8217;ve received.  I obviously can&amp;#8217;t make any guarantee as to the accuracy of this data.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Update &amp;#8211; 15th Apr 2009&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
I&amp;#8217;ve updated the link to the hmrc bank account site and added a table (to the bottom of this post) of sort code and account numbers to their cryptically named counterpart based on some of the comments to this post.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I needed to pay some money to &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.hmrc.gov.uk&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;caps&quot;&gt;HMRC&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt; to cover my tax.  &lt;span class=&quot;caps&quot;&gt;HMRC&lt;/span&gt; kindly supply me with their sort code and account number so that I could transfer the money directly from my bank account.  Logged into &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.hsbc.co.uk&quot;&gt;Hsbc&lt;/a&gt;, I entered the relevant details and tried to make the payment.  Instead of going through like a good payment should, I was presented with this useless error message.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.flickr.com/photos/chrisjroos/419309333/&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://farm1.static.flickr.com/130/419309333_f03474b3c8_m.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;#8220;We are unable to deal with your request. Please call us on 0845 600 2290 quoting reference 841, and we will be happy to help.  Select an option from the left-hand menu to continue.&amp;#8221;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I happen to know that, in English, this means, &amp;#8220;You have tried to make a payment to a known bank account using the Friends and Family option.  You&amp;#8217;re a dumbass.  It&amp;#8217;s obvious that instead of blindly typing in the sort code and account number, you should select from this helpful list of accounts that we already know about.&amp;#8221;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.flickr.com/photos/chrisjroos/419309488/&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://farm1.static.flickr.com/176/419309488_df2ab0fb53_m.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hmm, now if only I knew which of 12 cryptic names to choose I&amp;#8217;d be away&amp;#8230;  Anyway.  A short phone call later, filled with such insights as &amp;#8220;lots of people seem to phone up about this&amp;#8221;, and, &amp;#8220;we can&amp;#8217;t give out the list of names vs sort codes as it&amp;#8217;s against data protection&amp;#8221;, I was all set.  For anyone that cares, the sort code and account number I had (10-50-41 and 23456000) match to the incredibly obvious &amp;#8216;&lt;span class=&quot;caps&quot;&gt;HMRC&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;caps&quot;&gt;CORP&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;caps&quot;&gt;TAX&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;caps&quot;&gt;SHIP&lt;/span&gt;&amp;#8217;.  Actually, I&amp;#8217;ve just come across a &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.hmrc.gov.uk/payinghmrc/bank-account-checker.htm&quot;&gt;page&lt;/a&gt; detailing all the different &lt;span class=&quot;caps&quot;&gt;HMRC&lt;/span&gt; accounts and what they&amp;#8217;re for.  A quick scan suggests that you can probably derive the cryptic Hsbc name from the more human friendly name on that page.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If anyone happens to come across this page while searching for the error above, maybe you could leave details in the comments of the sort code, account number and Hsbc cryptic name, in order to help out any future visitors.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#8217;s been pointed out, by Zaib via email, that there&amp;#8217;s a list of these bank accounts on the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.hmrc.gov.uk/bankaccounts/&quot;&gt;hmrc site&lt;/a&gt;.  I&amp;#8217;d definitely recommend checking that official site in order to be confident that you&amp;#8217;ve got the correct sort code and account number.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

        <title>The worst word in the world... ever</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;I don&amp;#8217;t know why, but I really don&amp;#8217;t like the word &amp;#8216;texted&amp;#8217;.  It hurts my ears when I hear it, and my eyes when I see it.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

        <title>It'll grow back, right?</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;Hmm.  I need to remove this, very firmly attached, processor from the heatsink and fan assembly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://farm1.static.flickr.com/174/411792179_f302416633.jpg?v=0&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#8217;m sure if I just apply a little pressure&lt;sup class=&quot;footnote&quot; id=&quot;fnr2&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn2&quot;&gt;2&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;#8230;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Bugger.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In an effort to take something positive from the experience, I&amp;#8217;ve created a &lt;a href=&quot;http://flickr.com/photos/chrisjroos/sets/72157594571965120/&quot;&gt;photoset&lt;/a&gt; on &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.flickr.com&quot;&gt;flickr&lt;/a&gt; that describes the re-assembly process of the Sony Vaio K315B.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;footnote&quot; id=&quot;fn1&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fnr1&quot;&gt;&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/a&gt; More like a combination of pressure (on the processor, not me), lessening patience and a knife (resulting in two cut fingers.)  Ho hum.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

        <title>Digital Photo Prints from PhotoBox</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;I just wanted to write a short note to recommend &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.photobox.co.uk&quot;&gt;PhotoBox&lt;/a&gt;.  I&amp;#8217;ve been meaning to get some of my &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.flickr.com/photos/chrisjroos&quot;&gt;photos&lt;/a&gt; printed for a while, but was put off by having to pay for a service that I knew nothing about.  A short while ago, a friend &lt;a href=&quot;http://ademblog.blogspot.com/2007/02/is-that-where-it-ends-with-your-life.html&quot;&gt;mentioned&lt;/a&gt; photobox.  Not only do I trust Adem&amp;#8217;s opinion, but photobox were (and still are, having just checked their homepage) offering 30 free prints when you sign-up.  I signed up at around midday on Friday (23rd Feb 2007), selected 30 photos that I&amp;#8217;d like printed, and uploaded them to photobox.  I paid my ¬£1.50 postage and duly received my confirmation email at 16:27 that day.  The best thing was that 56 minutes later (17:23) I received an email to say that the photos had been dispatched.  That&amp;#8217;s pretty cool.  They were sent First Class with &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.royalmail.co.uk&quot;&gt;Royal Mail&lt;/a&gt; and I received them the next morning.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I know that Adem has already used their service again, and I can only imagine that I will too.  Would I have used them without Adem&amp;#8217;s advocacy?  Probably if they had the free offer (I&amp;#8217;d have nothing to lose after all), almost certainly not if they didn&amp;#8217;t.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After all that praise, I&amp;#8217;d like to suggest a couple of improvements.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;I already have all of my photos on &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.flickr.com&quot;&gt;flickr&lt;/a&gt;.  I should have been able to supply photobox with the location of these photos rather than having to painstakingly download and re-upload.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;I found the interface a little clumsy.  At the checkout, it looked like some of my photos were going to be cropped, even though I didn&amp;#8217;t ask for it, or see why they would be (they were &amp;#8216;photo-size&amp;#8217; already.)  This resulted in a bit of back and forth, on my part, through the interface, to ensure I hadn&amp;#8217;t selected some option by mistake (I hadn&amp;#8217;t and my photos weren&amp;#8217;t cropped.)  I feel that it could be made easier for the &amp;#8216;just upload and print&amp;#8217; crowd.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;</description>

        <title>Crashing IE 6 with style(sheets)</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;Over about the last day and a half, if you used &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet_Explorer_6&quot;&gt;Internet Explorer 6&lt;/a&gt; to browse any of the reviews on &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.reevoo.com&quot;&gt;reevoo.com&lt;/a&gt;, then we should apologise.  It seems that, apart from breaking the layout somewhat, we&amp;#8217;d actually managed to cause IE 6 to crash.  Not cool.  A concerted effort this morning got the problem sorted, but it took longer than it should&amp;#8217;ve done, especially when you consider that about 75% of our traffic is from users of IE 6&amp;#8230;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Anyway, with the embarrassment out of the way, I thought I&amp;#8217;d share the remotely interesting&lt;sup class=&quot;footnote&quot; id=&quot;fnr1&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn1&quot;&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; findings of the investigation into the browser crash.  It turns out that a combination of these three little lines of &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CSS&quot;&gt;css&lt;/a&gt;, and any &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Doctype&quot;&gt;doctype&lt;/a&gt; declaration&lt;sup class=&quot;footnote&quot; id=&quot;fnr2&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn2&quot;&gt;2&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;, will cause IE 6 to hang while waiting for the magic &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Control-Alt-Delete#Windows_NT&quot;&gt;Windows kiss of life&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class=&quot;code css&quot;&gt;
margin-left: 240px;
margin-right: 10%;
width: expression(document.body.offsetWidth - 256);
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is not the specific values (240px, 10% and 256) in the lines above that are of interest &amp;#8211; I was able to express and suppress the problem by altering those.  Unfortunately, I didn&amp;#8217;t spend any time trying to find the threshold of the problem, and am therefore unsure as to the reason for this behaviour.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The offending, nasty, IE hack has now been removed.  In addition, the day has been spent working with the &lt;a href=&quot;http://daftpixel.wordpress.com&quot;&gt;designer monkey&lt;/a&gt; (ahh, you can call him Adam if you like) to start tidying up the, still somewhat cumbersome, stylesheets.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For the curious, the simplest html page I could come up with that exhibits the crash behaviour in IE 6 is below.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class=&quot;code html&quot;&gt;
&amp;lt;!-- &amp;lt;!DOCTYPE HTML PUBLIC &quot;-//W3C//DTD HTML 4.01//EN&quot; &quot;http://www.w3.org/TR/html4/strict.dtd&quot;&amp;gt; --&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;!-- &amp;lt;!DOCTYPE HTML PUBLIC &quot;-//W3C//DTD HTML 4.01 Transitional//EN&quot; &quot;http://www.w3.org/TR/html4/loose.dtd&quot;&amp;gt; --&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;!-- &amp;lt;!DOCTYPE html PUBLIC &quot;-//W3C//DTD XHTML 1.0 Strict//EN&quot; &quot;http://www.w3.org/TR/xhtml1/DTD/xhtml1-strict.dtd&quot;&amp;gt; --&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;!-- &amp;lt;!DOCTYPE html PUBLIC &quot;-//W3C//DTD XHTML 1.0 Transitional//EN&quot; &quot;http://www.w3.org/TR/xhtml1/DTD/xhtml1-transitional.dtd&quot;&amp;gt; --&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;!-- ANY OF THE ABOVE DOCTYPES CAUSE THE PROBLEM.  NO DOCTYPE = NO PROBLEM --&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;html&amp;gt;
  &amp;lt;head&amp;gt;
    &amp;lt;style type=&quot;text/css&quot;&amp;gt;
      #content {
        margin-left: 240px;
        margin-right: 10%;
        width: expression(document.body.offsetWidth - 256);
      }
    &amp;lt;/style&amp;gt;
    &amp;lt;title&amp;gt;testing ie6&amp;lt;/title&amp;gt;
  &amp;lt;/head&amp;gt;
  &amp;lt;body&amp;gt;
    &amp;lt;div id=&quot;content&quot;&amp;gt;blurgh&amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;
  &amp;lt;/body&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;/html&amp;gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;footnote&quot; id=&quot;fn1&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fnr1&quot;&gt;&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/a&gt; They&amp;#8217;re really not interesting.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;footnote&quot; id=&quot;fn2&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fnr2&quot;&gt;&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/a&gt; If there is no doctype declaration, the browser doesn&amp;#8217;t crash (something to do with standards mode I believe).&lt;/p&gt;</description>

        <title>Visualising the changing responsibilities of objects</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;By parsing the output of svn diff, we can concisely display the responsibilities that have been added/removed to various objects.  It is based on the assumption that our tests capture these changes.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Combining distributed small tools as an alternative to Backpack et al</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;For a while now, I&amp;#8217;ve been thinking/dreaming of having a number of very specific, distributed services.  These would be no more than additions to the single purpose services we already use (notably, in my case, &lt;a href=&quot;http://flickr.com&quot;&gt;flickr&lt;/a&gt; for photos, this blog for articulating thought and &lt;a href=&quot;http://del.icio.us&quot;&gt;del.icio.us&lt;/a&gt; for storing bookmarks).  Some additions I&amp;#8217;d like to see&lt;sup class=&quot;footnote&quot; id=&quot;fnr1&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn1&quot;&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; are:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;A way to record and tag financial transactions&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Although I want to be able to record the transactions in some kind of accounting app, I also want each transaction to be a resource on the web that I can link to and bookmark (a RESTful accounts app if you like)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;A way to record and tag any text (i.e. thoughts and ideas that are not quite blog posts)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To be fair, a secondary blog could be set-up to do this.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;A way to add multiple comments to any resource on the web&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Think &amp;#8211; being able to bookmark the same uri multiple times in del.icio.us with different notes against each bookmark.  Actually, I wonder why these sort of distributed comment systems are not more prevalent &amp;#8211; it seems kinda odd that every blogging engine re-implements something that could be done once, and done well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;A way to expose an email or an email conversation at a given uri (a permailink maybe? he he)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I think one immediate benefit of this is the ability to share emails with people in the same organisation/group as you without having to forward them all on.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, how would having these types of services help us re-create a backpack type page at present?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Well, I&amp;#8217;m not sure how good this example is, but let&amp;#8217;s think of selling an item on &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.ebay.co.uk&quot;&gt;ebay&lt;/a&gt;.  At the moment, I end up with lots of distributed information about a single sale:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;invoices from ebay&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;transactions on a statement (from my bank and paypal)&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;emails from ebay and buyers&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;a page that represents the item on ebay&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;pictures of the item on flickr&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;physical receipts for posting the item&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is fine until you want to interrogate the data.  Try finding out how much money you made/lost, when it was sent, who it was sent to, and the problems are obvious.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One solution would be to record all the information for a given item in a page in backpack (or any similar service &amp;#8211; a simple wiki would do).  But now try to query the data for two items sold, or partially query one item and the problems become evident again.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I think this is where our funky new distributed system can help.  Following the same ebay selling process as above:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;We create a text snippet that provides us with a placeholder uri for this item.  This would be something like &amp;#8216;sale of computer&amp;#8217;&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;We upload photos of the item to flickr, tagged with our placeholder&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;We list the item in ebay, tagged with our placeholder&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;We record a financial transaction that represents the cost of listing the item, tagged with our placeholder&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;We upload any relevant emails from ebay about the listing/sale of our item, tagged with our placeholder&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;We record a financial transaction that represents our income from the sale of the item, tagged with our placeholder&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;We record a note that states when and how we sent the item, tagged with our placeholder&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;We record a financial transaction that represents our cost for sending the item, tagged with our placeholder&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The important thing is that all of these resources are tagged with a common uri.  The uri that represents our item for sale.  At the simplest level, this makes auto-generating a backpack type page very simple &amp;#8211; we just aggregate&lt;sup class=&quot;footnote&quot; id=&quot;fnr2&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn2&quot;&gt;2&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; all of the data tagged with our item uri.  Tagging these items with a higher level tag, such as &amp;#8216;ebay&amp;#8217;, will allow us to search across multiple sales/purchase.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Going even further, using opensearch with a simple custom front-end (basically just a parser) gives us even greater querying capabilities.  I could imagine searching for something like &amp;#8220;ebay finance:expenditure&amp;#8221; to get a list of all items (descriptions, notes, pictures etc) we&amp;#8217;ve sold on ebay along with our expenditure.  Our simple search engine would know to search for all items tagged with ebay, but only those transactions that are tagged with expenditure (i.e. costs to us).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Does this make sense/sound feasible to anyone else?  Indeed, has someone else already presented these ideas in a more legible/understandable way?  It all seems to make great sense to me but I&amp;#8217;ve spent quite a while thinking about it (and what seems like ages just writing this post), meaning there&amp;#8217;s every chance I&amp;#8217;ve missed something obvious.  I&amp;#8217;d appreciate any thoughts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;footnote&quot; id=&quot;fn1&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fnr1&quot;&gt;&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/a&gt; I did had every intention of developing these things as a proof of concept, but, on the basis that I&amp;#8217;m unlikely to get around to it, and that I do actually think something like this is a good idea, I thought I&amp;#8217;d jot my thoughts here.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;footnote&quot; id=&quot;fn2&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fnr2&quot;&gt;&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/a&gt; I started out thinking that the tags would be stored against the resource itself &amp;#8211; the same way that the tag for a photo in flickr is stored against that photo.  I was also assuming that these services would be &lt;a href=&quot;http://opensearch.org&quot;&gt;opensearch&lt;/a&gt; enabled to allow searching of the tags.  As I&amp;#8217;ve been writing the post I&amp;#8217;ve realised that, providing everything has a uri, we can use del.icio.us as our tagging mechanism and as our search engine.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

        <title>Encapsulation in Active Record objects</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#8217;ve been meaning to finish a post on this subject for ages.  As I probably won&amp;#8217;t finish it in its current incarnation, I thought I&amp;#8217;d at least get something up here.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.rubyonrails.org/api/classes/ActiveRecord/Base.html&quot;&gt;Active Record&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.rubyonrails.org/api/classes/ActiveRecord/Associations/ClassMethods.html&quot;&gt;associations&lt;/a&gt; are brilliant for quickly putting together an object graph.  They&amp;#8217;re not so brilliant for testing, or keeping the code particularly tidy.  They quickly lead to (and even encourage) train-wreck expressions in your code.  Diving straight into an example:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class=&quot;code ruby&quot;&gt;
class Person &amp;lt; ActiveRecord::Base
  has_many :hobbies
end
class Hobby &amp;lt; ActiveRecord::Base
  belongs_to :person
end
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Because the hobbies object is publicly accessible from a person object, it allows us to reach in and touch things we shouldn&amp;#8217;t.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class=&quot;code ruby&quot;&gt;
cycling = Hobby.new

# We shouldn&#39;t manipulate the hobbies object directly...
chris = Person.new
chris.hobbies.add(cycling) # Uh oh - touching things we shouldn&#39;t

# ...rather, it&#39;d be better to add a wrapper method for the functionality we actually need
class Person &amp;lt; ActiveRecord::Base
  def add_hobby(hobby)
    hobbies.add(hobby)
  end
end
chris = Person.new
chris.add_hobby(cycling) # Ahh, that&#39;s much better
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The revised Person class above follows the &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Law_of_Demeter&quot;&gt;law of demeter&lt;/a&gt;.  As well as making the code look a little neater (no train-wrecks to see here), it makes it easier to test.  To illustrate the testing point, I&amp;#8217;m going to &lt;a href=&quot;http://weblog.jamisbuck.org/2007/1/9/extending-activerecord-associations&quot;&gt;extend&lt;/a&gt; the &lt;a href=&quot;http://ryandaigle.com/articles/2006/12/03/extend-your-activerecord-association-methods&quot;&gt;association&lt;/a&gt; in this example.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class=&quot;code ruby&quot;&gt;
# We end up with a large and not very clear test
class Person &amp;lt; ActiveRecord::Base
  has_many :hobbies do
    def find_favourite
      find(:first, :conditions =&amp;gt; [&#39;favourite = true&#39;])
    end
  end
end

class MyContrivedTest &amp;lt; Test::Unit::TestCase
  def test_should_find_my_favourite_hobby
    hobbies = mock
    hobbies.expects(:find_favourite)
    person = stub(:hobbies =&amp;gt; hobbies)
    hobby_finder = HobbyFinder.new
    hobby_finder.find_favourite(person)
  end
end

# This way, we end up with a slightly cleaner looking class (imo) and a smaller, cleaner test
class Person &amp;lt; ActiveRecord::Base
  has_many :hobbies
  def find_my_favourite_hobby
    hobbies.find(:first, :conditions =&amp;gt; [&#39;favourite = true&#39;])
  end
end

class MyContrivedTest &amp;lt; Test::Unit::TestCase
  def test_should_find_my_favourite_hobby
    person = mock
    person.expects(:find_my_favourite_hobby)
    hobby_finder = HobbyFinder.new
    hobby_finder.find_favourite(person)
  end
end
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Interestingly enough, if we had &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Test_driven_development&quot;&gt;test driven&lt;/a&gt; the development of the above code, we would almost certainly have ended up with something similar (interface-wise) to the example that has a wrapper around the association proxy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, with all of this in mind, I&amp;#8217;ve hacked together a real quick &lt;a href=&quot;http://chrisroos.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/plugins/private_associations/&quot;&gt;plugin&lt;/a&gt; that adds a corresponding &lt;em&gt;private method for each of the four (has_one, has_many, belongs_to and has_and_belongs_to&lt;/em&gt;many) associations.  Using the _private alternative will do exactly the same as the original method but it will make all of the dynamically created methods private.  So.  It&amp;#8217;ll still be possible to write the wrapper around the association (as we did in the test above) but it won&amp;#8217;t be possible to reach in and touch things that we shouldn&amp;#8217;t.&lt;sup class=&quot;footnote&quot; id=&quot;fnr1&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn1&quot;&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is at least one problem (there may be many more I&amp;#8217;m not aware of) with using the &lt;em&gt;private association methods.  If you have validation set-up for one of the associations (e.g. validates&lt;/em&gt;associated) it will fail.  This is because validation happens from outside the instance of the object and therefore needs to access the association.  Although I haven&amp;#8217;t thought this through fully, I&amp;#8217;m actually wondering if validation (in its current form) takes a bit of a back seat under this new world order.  I think that one of the reasons validation is on the object itself is because there are many many ways to create the said object.  However, using these private associations and disabling the persistence methods (create, save, update etc) on an associated object may allow us to have a single point of object creation and persistence.  If we had that, then we wouldn&amp;#8217;t need the Active Record validations anyway.  Just a thought&amp;#8230;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Just one final note.  &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.daveastels.com/&quot;&gt;Dave Astels&lt;/a&gt; has a good &lt;a href=&quot;http://blog.daveastels.com/articles/2006/10/24/encapsulation-in-action&quot;&gt;article&lt;/a&gt; about encapsulation in rails, as &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.reevoo.com/blogs/bengriffiths/2006/10/24/rails-like-or-oo/&quot;&gt;referred to&lt;/a&gt; by &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.reevoo.com/blogs/bengriffiths&quot;&gt;Ben&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;footnote&quot; id=&quot;fn1&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fnr1&quot;&gt;&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/a&gt; Ok.  That is, of course, a blatant lie &amp;#8211; we can still access the private association &amp;#8211; this is &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.ruby-lang.org&quot;&gt;ruby&lt;/a&gt; remember.  The important point is that we&amp;#8217;ve made our intentions more explicit.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

        <description>&lt;p&gt;Ah, a seetickets.com email has fallen into my spam bucket.  I don&amp;#8217;t really read them anyway, I might as well unsubscribe.  Not so fast though it seems&amp;#8230;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;First of all, what&amp;#8217;s the deal with the email confirmation box?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://farm1.static.flickr.com/151/346810590_00bbd1598c_o.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Oh well, might as well fill it in and submit.  But wait.  What&amp;#8217;s this?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://farm1.static.flickr.com/126/346810700_29ff72c5a4_o.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Wow, an email server that takes upto 60 seconds to:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class=&quot;code sql&quot;&gt;
DELETE FROM newsletters WHERE email = &#39;MY_EMAIL&#39;;
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Oh well, I best click OK and wait.  Oh.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Homegrown gooogie</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;So, I just saw a &lt;a href=&quot;http://blog.outer-court.com/archive/2007-01-04.html#n31&quot;&gt;post&lt;/a&gt; about &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.gooogie.co.uk&quot;&gt;gooogie&lt;/a&gt;, and it reminded me of my &lt;a href=&quot;/blog/2006-12-15-might-as-well-aim-high&quot;&gt;own&lt;/a&gt;, &amp;#8216;did you mean&amp;#8217;, page&lt;sup class=&quot;footnote&quot; id=&quot;fnr1&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn1&quot;&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You can achieve the same effect as gooogie by using the excellent &lt;a href=&quot;https://addons.mozilla.org/firefox/1843/&quot;&gt;firebug&lt;/a&gt; firefox extension to execute javascript in the context of the page you are viewing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To achieve the effect:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Open up &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.google.co.uk&quot;&gt;google&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Type something into the search box that will generate a &amp;#8216;did you mean&amp;#8217; response (tip. use any &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.google.co.uk/search?hl=en&amp;amp;q=mispeled&amp;amp;btnG=Google+Search&quot;&gt;misspelled&lt;/a&gt; word)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Use the handy &lt;a href=&quot;https://addons.mozilla.org/firefox/1192/&quot;&gt;XPather&lt;/a&gt; firefox extension to find the XPath expression of the suggested word (in italics).  At this time, the relevant xpath seems to be &amp;#8216;/html/body/p&lt;sup class=&quot;footnote&quot; id=&quot;fnr1&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn1&quot;&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;/a/b/i&amp;#8217;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Fire up firebug and execute the following line in the console, substituting your desired suggestion first (the text on the page should change immediately)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;pre class=&quot;code javascript&quot;&gt;
document.evaluate(&#39;/html/body/p[1]/a/b/i&#39;, document, null, XPathResult.ANY_TYPE, null).iterateNext().textContent = &#39;THE_WORD_YOU_WANT_TO_SUGGEST&#39;
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Finish by typing a new word into the search box and taking a screenshot to impress your friends (or not, as the case may be).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On second thoughts, just use gooogie, it&amp;#8217;s much quicker and cross-browser compatible.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;footnote&quot; id=&quot;fn1&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fnr1&quot;&gt;&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/a&gt; A handful of people have stated that they don&amp;#8217;t get the &amp;#8216;did you mean reevoo&amp;#8217; message when typing &amp;#8216;review&amp;#8217; into google.  Well, no, they wouldn&amp;#8217;t.  It&amp;#8217;s completely made up.  He he.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

&lt;p&gt;And, from a &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.shozu.com&quot;&gt;site&lt;/a&gt; that requires your mobile number as part of the signup process &amp;#8211; seems to me that they&amp;#8217;d be better off using that to filter automated signups.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I hate captchas.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

        <title>Addicted to twitter.com</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;But not because of a craving to be loved.  Honest.  For a long time I&amp;#8217;ve wanted to be able to interact with a computer/remote process via sms.  Just this morning I was struck with what I thought was an amazing idea.  I&amp;#8217;d heard of &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.twitter.com&quot;&gt;twitter&lt;/a&gt; and wondered if I might be able to use it as a type of sms gateway.  Turns out that I could.  Yay.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To play along, you will need:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;One twitter account with a registered mobile&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;One twitter account that is a friend of the first account (with the mobile)&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;A tiny bit of ruby script&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;pre class=&quot;code ruby&quot;&gt;
require &#39;rubygems&#39;
require &#39;json&#39;

RECEIVER_USERNAME = &#39;USERNAME_OF_MOBILE_ACCOUNT&#39;
RECEIVER_PASSWORD = &#39;PASSWORD_OF_MOBILE_ACCOUNT&#39;
js = `curl -u&quot;#{RECEIVER_USERNAME}:#{RECEIVER_PASSWORD}&quot; http://twitter.com/statuses/friends_timeline.json`

text = JSON.parse(js).first[&#39;text&#39;]

SENDER_USERNAME = &#39;USERNAME_OF_FRIEND&#39;
SENDER_PASSWORD = &#39;PASSWORD_OF_FRIEND&#39;

`curl -u&quot;#{SENDER_USERNAME}:#{SENDER_PASSWORD}&quot; -d&quot;status=#{text.reverse}&quot; http://twitter.com/statuses/update.xml`
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The script just reads the most recent message sent to your mobile twitter account, reverses the text and sends it back to your mobile.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is all free stuff, and although the twitter terms of service don&amp;#8217;t appear to explicitly disallow us doing this, I think you should probably be nice if you&amp;#8217;re going to use it in this way.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

        <title>Reevoo.com dips its toes into the opensearch water</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;So.  What does that mean exactly?  Well, right at the moment, not a great deal.  It pretty much means that you can add the ability to search reevoo.com to the Firefox 2 and IE7 browsers very easily.  Visiting &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.reevoo.com&quot;&gt;reevoo.com&lt;/a&gt; with either of these browsers will highlight part of the &amp;#8216;search box&amp;#8217;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://static.flickr.com/126/321626445_dfe00b4e0e.jpg?v=0&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;IE 7 changes the little arrow to a goldy, orangey, yellowy type colour to indicate the presence of an opensearch enabled search engine.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://static.flickr.com/132/321626424_d6ec54a53b.jpg?v=0&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While Firefox 2 opts for a blue surround and additionally chooses to add our logo.  Woot.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;I appreciate that I can now easily search reevoo from anywhere but was it really worth a blog post?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hmm, interesting question (that wasn&amp;#8217;t an actual question, I just made it up).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Actually, I think that &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.opensearch.org&quot;&gt;opensearch&lt;/a&gt; is pretty cool.  At the moment, we are just exposing our search results in their html form.  Just imagine, for a second, that we were instead, exposing our results as &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atom_%28standard%29&quot;&gt;atom&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RSS_%28file_format%29&quot;&gt;rss&lt;/a&gt; feeds.  Now, also imagine&lt;sup class=&quot;footnote&quot; id=&quot;fnr1&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn1&quot;&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; that retailers felt like being a little more open; and, as such, were offering an opensearch description of their search capabilities, along with search results in atom or rss feeds.  All we&amp;#8217;d need then was an &lt;a href=&quot;http://a9.com&quot;&gt;aggregator&lt;/a&gt; that would allow us to search for products across our chosen retailers and reevoo in one go.  The result would be a page containing both product reviews and pricing and stock availability from each retailer.  That, I think, would be pretty damn cool.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;footnote&quot; id=&quot;fn1&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fnr1&quot;&gt;&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/a&gt; Currently, this requires a lot of imagination.  A quick browse this afternoon found four big retailers that don&amp;#8217;t even have working search without javascript enabled.  At least they&amp;#8217;ve got &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.w3.org/Provider/Style/URI&quot;&gt;well&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;http://wiki.welldesignedurls.org/Main_Page&quot;&gt;designed&lt;/a&gt; urls.  Oh, hang on&amp;#8230;&lt;/p&gt;</description>

        <title>Crappy ruby script to download photos from a flickr photoset</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;So, it seems far more difficult than it should be to retrieve a bunch of &lt;strong&gt;my&lt;/strong&gt; photos from flickr.com.  Having unsuccessfully experimented with some of the flickr libs on &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.rubyforge.org&quot;&gt;rubyforge&lt;/a&gt; I hacked this together.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;caps&quot;&gt;UPDATE&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;: Something caused curl to get &amp;#8216;stuck&amp;#8217; downloading a particular picture so I amended the script to ensure it ignores already downloaded files.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;caps&quot;&gt;UPDATE&lt;/span&gt; 2&lt;/strong&gt;: Surround output filename with quotes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class=&quot;code ruby&quot;&gt;
require &#39;cgi&#39;

API_KEY = &#39;YOUR_API_KEY&#39;
PHOTOSET_ID = &#39;YOUR_PHOTOSET_ID&#39;
LOCAL_PHOTO_DIR = &#39;/users/chrisroos/desktop/photos/&#39;

curl_cmd = %[curl &quot;http://api.flickr.com/services/rest/?method=flickr.photosets.getPhotos&amp;amp;api_key=#{API_KEY}&amp;amp;photoset_id=#{PHOTOSET_ID}&quot;]
photoset_photos = `#{curl_cmd}`

number_of_photos = photoset_photos.scan(/&amp;lt;photo .*&amp;gt;/).size
current_photo = 0

photoset_photos.scan(/&amp;lt;photo .*&amp;gt;/) do |line|
  current_photo += 1

  photo_id = line[/id=&quot;(\d+)&quot;/, 1]
  photo_secret = line[/secret=&quot;(\w+)&quot;/, 1]
  photo_server = line[/server=&quot;(\d+)&quot;/, 1]
  photo_title = line[/title=&quot;(.+?)&quot;/, 1]

  url = &quot;http://static.flickr.com/#{photo_server}/#{photo_id}_#{photo_secret}_o_d.jpg&quot;
  filename = CGI.unescapeHTML(photo_title).gsub(/ |&amp;amp;|,|-/, &#39;_&#39;).gsub(/&#39;/, &#39;&#39;).downcase.squeeze(&#39;_&#39;) + &#39;_&#39; + photo_id + &#39;.jpg&#39; # Sanitize title to use as filename
  filepath = LOCAL_PHOTO_DIR + filename

  if File.exists?(filepath)
    puts &quot;Skipping photo (already downloaded) #{current_photo} of #{number_of_photos}&quot;
  else
    puts &quot;Retrieving photo #{current_photo} of #{number_of_photos}&quot;
    curl_cmd = %[curl &quot;#{url}&quot; &amp;gt; &quot;#{filepath}&quot;]
    `#{curl_cmd}`
  end
end

        <title>del.icio.us as a simple to do list</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;I often come across resources on the web that I&amp;#8217;m interested in but want to look at in more detail later.  I currently use a combination of: storing urls in text files, placing links in my &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.backpackit.com&quot;&gt;backpack&lt;/a&gt;, storing bookmarks in my browser and, in the past, tagging links with &lt;a href=&quot;http://del.icio.us/tag/to_read&quot;&gt;to_read&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=&quot;http://del.icio.us&quot;&gt;del.icio.us&lt;/a&gt;.  I inevitably end up forgetting where I&amp;#8217;ve stored these &amp;#8216;bookmarks&amp;#8217; and therefore miss out on that resource&lt;sup class=&quot;footnote&quot; id=&quot;fnr1&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn1&quot;&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;.  In an attempt to consolidate places I can hide information, I&amp;#8217;ve created a todo bundle in del.icio.us that currently contains the to_watch and to_read tags.  Doing that today ensured that I remembered to watch a &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.identity20.com/media/OSCON2005/&quot;&gt;great presentation&lt;/a&gt; by &lt;a href=&quot;http://blame.ca/dick/&quot;&gt;Dick Hardt&lt;/a&gt; on the subject of &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.identity20.com&quot;&gt;identity 2.0&lt;/a&gt;.  Cool.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;footnote&quot; id=&quot;fn1&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fnr1&quot;&gt;&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/a&gt; You could probably argue that because I forget about the resource, I can&amp;#8217;t have been &lt;em&gt;that&lt;/em&gt; interested in the first place&amp;#8230;&lt;/p&gt;</description>

        <title>Amazing non-customer service</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;I heard (well, read) about &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.wesabe.com&quot;&gt;wesabe&lt;/a&gt; this morning and thought I&amp;#8217;d sign-up to find out what it was all about.  During the sign-up process I was asked for &lt;em&gt;two&lt;/em&gt; security questions and answers &amp;#8211; to be used in the event of me forgetting my password.  Although I was unable&lt;sup class=&quot;footnote&quot; id=&quot;fnr1&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn1&quot;&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; to sign-up and use the service, I still got an amazing &amp;#8216;non-customer experience&amp;#8217;.  I was curious as to why they wanted me to answer two security questions in order to sign-up, and emailed them to that affect.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I was about to signup to wesabe but I&amp;#8217;ve been rejected by not entering my security questions.  I&amp;#8217;m genuinely interested in your decision to require two security questions as well as an email address.  I get the impression that the current trend is to ask for an email address and provide a &amp;#8216;reset password&amp;#8217; type link that mails out a new password &amp;#8211; maybe you are more aware of this due to the type of data being stored?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That was sent at 08:14.  This reply was received at 08:19.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yes, your guess is spot on.  During our preview/beta period, one of the most common requests we had was for password resets.  It was easy enough to verify the source of those requests when we knew all of our users, but as the preview group grew, we weren&amp;#8217;t able to confirm that we were actually resetting a password for the right person.  When we talked it over, we decided to use the model set by PayPal, since that seemed like the closest analog to our service in web applications.  Using a combination of security questions and access to a set email address provides two levels of authentication, and that&amp;#8217;s what we wanted.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I really want signup to be easier and faster, and yet still have people be able to get back to their data &amp;#8211; and only their data &amp;#8211; whenever they want.  I&amp;#8217;m not happy with the length of the signup form, but it seems better than other options I&amp;#8217;ve found so far.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you have suggestions or comments on this, I&amp;#8217;d be very interested.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Whoah.  That&amp;#8217;s pretty cool.  Right!?  I&amp;#8217;ve actually had a very similar experience with &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.claimid.com&quot;&gt;claimid&lt;/a&gt;.  I asked them to &lt;a href=&quot;http://blog.claimid.com/2006/05/tips-and-tricks-your-name-in-the-url/&quot;&gt;change my username&lt;/a&gt; and the response confirming their action was through within ten minutes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In a &amp;#8220;we wanna be that cool too&amp;#8221; stylee, I&amp;#8217;m opening myself up to spam galore&lt;sup class=&quot;footnote&quot; id=&quot;fnr2&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn2&quot;&gt;2&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; by offering my email address for your delectation:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;mailto:chrisroos@reevoo.com&quot;&gt;chrisroos@reevoo.com&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Feel free to email me, why not.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;footnote&quot; id=&quot;fn1&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fnr1&quot;&gt;&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/a&gt; There&amp;#8217;s a little white lie there to be fair.  Of course I &lt;em&gt;could&amp;#8217;ve&lt;/em&gt; signed up.  They didn&amp;#8217;t put a spell on me (although that&amp;#8217;d be cool) or anything.  It&amp;#8217;s just that I feel uncomfortable giving out the answers to real questions (mother&amp;#8217;s maiden name) and there&amp;#8217;s zero chance of me remembering the answer to made up questions (favourite colour/day/smell).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;footnote&quot; id=&quot;fn2&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fnr2&quot;&gt;&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/a&gt; I was going to cleverly protect my email addresses from prying robot eyes&amp;#8230;  but really can&amp;#8217;t be bothered.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

        <title>Maybe I need some more REST</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;This post isn&amp;#8217;t about sleep deprevation.  Instead, the witty title is referring to everyone&amp;#8217;s newest, favouritist buzzword: &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.wikipedia.org/wiki/REST&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;caps&quot;&gt;REST&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt; (or Representational State Transfer).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Scene setting with some things that have happened recently (in roughly this order):&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.reevoo.com/blogs/bengriffiths/&quot;&gt;Ben&lt;/a&gt; mentions that we need to think about splitting our application up to better distribute the load on servers.  I don&amp;#8217;t completely &amp;#8216;get it&amp;#8217;.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.rubyonrails.com&quot;&gt;Rails&lt;/a&gt; gets &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.wikipedia.org/wiki/REST&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;caps&quot;&gt;REST&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt; support &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.ryandaigle.com/articles/2006/08/01/whats-new-in-edge-rails-simply-restful-support-and-how-to-use-it&quot;&gt;baked in&lt;/a&gt; (Ok, so this is pretty old news now)&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;We spent quite a lot of time at &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.reevoo.com&quot;&gt;work&lt;/a&gt; writing code to access the &lt;a href=&quot;http://adwords.google.com&quot;&gt;google adwords&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.google.com/apis/adwords/&quot;&gt;soap api&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;I finally got (thanks to &lt;a href=&quot;http://blog.floehopper.org&quot;&gt;James&lt;/a&gt;) why &lt;a href=&quot;http://habtm.com/articles/2006/07/01/if-your-models-arent-namespaced-why-should-your-controllers-be-or-how-i-learned-to-stop-worrying-and-love-the-crud&quot;&gt;some&lt;/a&gt; rails folk have stated that following a RESTful design frees them up from having namespaced admin controllers.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;I spent quite a bit of time over the last two weeks really looking into the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc4287.txt&quot;&gt;atom syndication format&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.ietf.org/internet-drafts/draft-ietf-atompub-protocol-11.txt&quot;&gt;atom publishing protocol&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;I spent a few hours at the weekend playing with the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.amazon.com/s3&quot;&gt;amazon s3&lt;/a&gt; service&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://wanderingbarque.com/nonintersecting/2006/11/15/the-s-stands-for-simple/&quot;&gt;This&lt;/a&gt; popped up recently and got an incredible amount of attention.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;I read an &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.acmqueue.com/modules.php?name=Content&amp;amp;pa=showpage&amp;amp;pid=388&quot;&gt;interview&lt;/a&gt; with &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.allthingsdistributed.com/&quot;&gt;Werner Vogel&lt;/a&gt; (&lt;span class=&quot;caps&quot;&gt;CTO&lt;/span&gt; of Amazon) that talks about everything being a service.  One quote in particular caught my attention.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you hit the Amazon.com gateway page, the application calls more than 100 services to collect data and construct the page for you.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;I took the plunge and just about stayed awake through &lt;a href=&quot;http://roy.gbiv.com/pubs/dissertation/top.htm&quot;&gt;The Document&lt;/a&gt;.  I found chapter 6 (and in particular 6.3.4) the most relevant as it explains &lt;span class=&quot;caps&quot;&gt;REST&lt;/span&gt; in the context of the &lt;span class=&quot;caps&quot;&gt;URI&lt;/span&gt; and &lt;span class=&quot;caps&quot;&gt;HTTP&lt;/span&gt;.  I tend to drift off on when things are explained without real examples.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;I watched &lt;a href=&quot;http://nubyonrails.com&quot;&gt;Geoffrey Grosenbach&amp;#8217;s&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.peepcode.org&quot;&gt;peepcode&lt;/a&gt; screencast on &lt;a href=&quot;http://peepcode.com/articles/2006/10/08/restful-rails&quot;&gt;restful rails&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;I worked out how to use &lt;a href=&quot;http://del.icio.us&quot;&gt;del.icio.us&lt;/a&gt; and subscribed to some of the tags (keywords) mentioned above.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Wow.  You&amp;#8217;d think with all that reading, listening and viewing I&amp;#8217;d be right up on the subject.  Sadly I don&amp;#8217;t feel as though that&amp;#8217;s quite the case.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now.  I do see an advantage of a RESTful approach (particular the style currently advocated in &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.rubyonrails.com&quot;&gt;rails&lt;/a&gt;), over &lt;span class=&quot;caps&quot;&gt;SOAP&lt;/span&gt;, when dealing with something like the google adwords api&lt;sup class=&quot;footnote&quot; id=&quot;fnr1&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn1&quot;&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;.  But, what about services like currency conversion and syntax highlighting?  I can&amp;#8217;t get these to fit into a RESTful style in my head (I guess I can&amp;#8217;t find the resource in each case).  Instead, I see them as analogous to unix command line applications: pipe simple data in (an amount with two curencies or ruby code) and get simple data out (an amount in the new currency or syntax-highlighted ruby code).  Actually, I see them as remote procedure calls.  Are these types of services incompatible with the &lt;span class=&quot;caps&quot;&gt;REST&lt;/span&gt; architectural style or have I missed something?  I&amp;#8217;m starting to wonder if I&amp;#8217;m getting too hung up on &lt;span class=&quot;caps&quot;&gt;REST&lt;/span&gt; = &lt;span class=&quot;caps&quot;&gt;CRUD&lt;/span&gt; and therefore missing some of the more fundamental points.  Either way, I definitely feel that it&amp;#8217;d be good to see some more concrete examples in the &lt;span class=&quot;caps&quot;&gt;REST&lt;/span&gt; vs &lt;span class=&quot;caps&quot;&gt;SOAP&lt;/span&gt;/&lt;span class=&quot;caps&quot;&gt;RPC&lt;/span&gt;/&lt;span class=&quot;caps&quot;&gt;SOA&lt;/span&gt; arguments.  As stated above, I&amp;#8217;m not so great in the abstract.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;footnote&quot; id=&quot;fn1&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fnr1&quot;&gt;&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/a&gt; I had a few problems when interacting with the adwords api.  I don&amp;#8217;t, however, feel that I have enough information to know whether the pain was caused by &lt;a href=&quot;http://dev.ctor.org/soap4r&quot;&gt;soap4r&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SOAP&quot;&gt;soap&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.google.com/apis/adwords/&quot;&gt;api&lt;/a&gt; or just my lack of knowledge.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

        <title>Telephone numbers for form submissions</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;I don&amp;#8217;t like giving out my real contact details in surveys / on-line forms, particularly telephone numbers.  I&amp;#8217;m not an amazing fan of the telephone and as such very rarely (unless-I&amp;#8217;m-really-certain-I-know-who-is-calling-and-even-then-it&amp;#8217;s-not-guaranteed) answer it.  For this reason, I feel fairly justified in not wanting to enter my number into surveys / on-line forms.  I&amp;#8217;m also pretty confident that the number of people that actually &lt;em&gt;need&lt;/em&gt; a number to contact me on, are very very very few and far between.  So, if they don&amp;#8217;t need my number, I guess they are either following the crowd, &amp;#8220;but all the other forms ask for it&amp;#8221;, or, they want to do bad things with it.  Either way, I&amp;#8217;d rather they didn&amp;#8217;t have it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is a point (and a link no-less) to this rant.  Honest.  Wait.  It&amp;#8217;s coming&amp;#8230;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.ofcom.org.uk/telecoms/ioi/numbers/num_drama&quot;&gt;Ofcom&amp;#8217;s list of reserved numbers for official form filling in use&lt;sup class=&quot;footnote&quot; id=&quot;fnr1&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn1&quot;&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I remembered this from the oftel days of yore but had been unable to find it in more recent searches.  Luckily, &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UK_telephone_numbering_plan&quot;&gt;wikipedia&lt;/a&gt; came to the rescue this evening&lt;sup class=&quot;footnote&quot; id=&quot;fnr2&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn2&quot;&gt;2&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;footnote&quot; id=&quot;fn1&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fnr1&quot;&gt;&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/a&gt; That&amp;#8217;s quite clearly not their actual intended purpose.  Right.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;footnote&quot; id=&quot;fn2&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fnr2&quot;&gt;&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/a&gt; In the past, when requested for landline number, I&amp;#8217;ve entered my, relatively recently disconnected, landline number.  There&amp;#8217;s every chance that this has been (or is scheduled to be) re-allocated &amp;#8211; prompting me to find a new number.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

        <title>Google AdWords Api Internal Error using the Sandbox</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;This has come up on the &lt;a href=&quot;http://groups-beta.google.com/group/adwords-api&quot;&gt;list&lt;/a&gt; a few times.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#8217;ve personally found it to occur when the sandbox gets reset (i.e. data from the sandbox is deleted by google).  The solution in this instance is to remove the clientEmail from the soap headers.  Make one request without it and then you can add it back in again.  I guess it&amp;#8217;s to do with the way that the accounts get auto created on the first request.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

        <title>Connecting to gmail with Ruby (or Connecting to POP3 servers over SSL with Ruby)</title>
        <description>&lt;h2&gt;Short version (or, &amp;#8220;I want to connect to gmail &lt;span class=&quot;caps&quot;&gt;NOW&lt;/span&gt;&amp;#8221;)&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Download the &lt;a href=&quot;http://ruby-doc.org/stdlib-1.9/libdoc/net/pop/rdoc/index.html&quot;&gt;pop3 library&lt;/a&gt; from &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.ruby-lang.org/cgi-bin/cvsweb.cgi//?only_with_tag=HEAD&quot;&gt;Ruby &lt;span class=&quot;caps&quot;&gt;HEAD&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt; (Ruby 1.9) (&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.ruby-lang.org/cgi-bin/cvsweb.cgi/~checkout~/ruby/lib/net/pop.rb?rev=1.73;content-type=application%2Fx-ruby;only_with_tag=HEAD&quot;&gt;download file&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Use the following script to get started (making sure that you explicitly reference the downloaded pop3 file)&amp;#8230;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;pre class=&quot;code ruby&quot;&gt;
require &#39;pop_ssl&#39; # I renamed the file from pop.rb to pop_ssl.rb to ensure I was requiring the correct version

username = &#39;YOUR_GMAIL_USERNAME@gmail.com&#39;
password = &#39;YOUR_GMAIL_PASSWORD&#39;

Net::POP3.enable_ssl(OpenSSL::SSL::VERIFY_NONE)
Net::POP3.start(&#39;pop.gmail.com&#39;, 995, username, password) do |pop|
  if pop.mails.empty?
    puts &#39;No mail.&#39;
  else
    pop.each_mail do |mail|
      p mail.header
    end
  end
end
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Medium version (or, &amp;#8220;Let me know I&amp;#8217;m connecting to the correct site, Dammit&amp;#8221;)&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is identical to the short version except that we verify the ssl certificate this time round.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Follow the first step above (i.e. download new version of pop3 lib).&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Download the CA Root Certificates bundle from &lt;a href=&quot;http://curl.haxx.se/&quot;&gt;cURL site&lt;/a&gt; (&lt;a href=&quot;http://curl.haxx.se/ca/cacert.pem&quot;&gt;download file&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Copy the code above but change the Net::POP3.enable_ssl line to read&amp;#8230;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;pre class=&quot;code ruby&quot;&gt;
Net::POP3.enable_ssl(OpenSSL::SSL::VERIFY_PEER, &#39;/PATH/TO/DOWNLOADED/cacert.pem&#39;)
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Longer version (or, &amp;#8220;Pray tell, how did you find this information sir&amp;#8221;)&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;An explanation of how I got here.  Feel free to ignore.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For a while I&amp;#8217;ve wanted to play around with receiving emails within a &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.rubyonrails.org&quot;&gt;rails&lt;/a&gt; app (with &lt;a href=&quot;http://am.rubyonrails.org/files/README.html&quot;&gt;action mailer&lt;/a&gt;).  I had an hour or two free the other evening and so started to play.  First step was to take a look at the &lt;a href=&quot;http://wiki.rubyonrails.org&quot;&gt;rails wiki&lt;/a&gt; and see that there&amp;#8217;s already a &lt;a href=&quot;http://wiki.rubyonrails.org/rails/pages/HowToReceiveEmailsWithActionMailer&quot;&gt;page&lt;/a&gt; detailing exactly what I wanted to do.  As I started reading, I was getting put off by the thought of configuring &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.sendmail.org&quot;&gt;sendmail&lt;/a&gt; or some other &amp;#8216;heavyweight&amp;#8217; solution.  Luckily, someone has added a much better suggestion at the bottom of the page &amp;#8211; using &lt;a href=&quot;http://ruby-doc.org/stdlib/libdoc/net/pop/rdoc/index.html&quot;&gt;net/pop&lt;/a&gt; (or &lt;a href=&quot;http://ruby-doc.org/stdlib/libdoc/net/imap/rdoc/index.html&quot;&gt;net/imap&lt;/a&gt;) to collect emails from a pre-configured mail server.  Although I use &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.fastmail.co.uk&quot;&gt;imap&lt;/a&gt; for my own email provision, I wanted a pop server for testing.  Aha, I thought, I&amp;#8217;ll just set-up another &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.gmail.com&quot;&gt;gmail&lt;/a&gt; account and use that&amp;#8230;  And that&amp;#8217;s where the problems started.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You see, gmail only accepts &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/POP3&quot;&gt;POP3&lt;/a&gt; connections over &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SSL&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;caps&quot;&gt;SSL&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt; (on port 995), a feature not found in our beloved net/pop library.  Hmm.  Time for some help from google.  The first page I &lt;a href=&quot;http://involution.com/2006/07/20/access-gmail-from-ruby-using-netpop3-and-stunnel/&quot;&gt;came across&lt;/a&gt; described using &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.stunnel.org&quot;&gt;stunnel&lt;/a&gt; to create an ssl tunnel to route standard net/pop traffic through.  This sounded great, except that I couldn&amp;#8217;t get stunnel (v4.16) to compile on mac os x, although I didn&amp;#8217;t try too hard&amp;#8230;  The other point of interest in that original article was that the pop3 with ssl support was in development.  The next step was to track down some mailing list threads that talked about the ssl support and hope for a patch.  We&amp;#8217;re in luck, the &lt;a href=&quot;http://blade.nagaokaut.ac.jp/cgi-bin/scat.rb/ruby/ruby-core/2703&quot;&gt;first patch&lt;/a&gt; was actually submitted in March 2004, with the second, accepted and committed, &lt;a href=&quot;http://blade.nagaokaut.ac.jp/cgi-bin/scat.rb/ruby/ruby-core/2745&quot;&gt;patch&lt;/a&gt; coming in April 2004.  As per the &lt;a href=&quot;http://blade.nagaokaut.ac.jp/cgi-bin/scat.rb/ruby/ruby-core/2780&quot;&gt;last message&lt;/a&gt; in the second thread, the patch was accepted into core, and is now available in the 1.9 release.  So, we don&amp;#8217;t even need to patch our existing copy of net/pop, we can just download the newer version.  I named this downloaded version as pop_ssl, to avoid confusion, and placed it in my ruby load path.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Next step was to follow the example on the &lt;a href=&quot;http://ruby-doc.org/stdlib-1.9/libdoc/net/pop/rdoc/classes/Net/POP3.html&quot;&gt;net/pop3 page&lt;/a&gt;, and, with the addition of the Net::POP3::enable_ssl directive, try to connect.  Hmm, things still weren&amp;#8217;t working quite right.  I was getting the following error.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class=&quot;code&quot;&gt;
OpenSSL::SSL::SSLError: certificate verify failed
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some more googling led me to &lt;a href=&quot;http://ghouston.blogspot.com/2006/03/using-ssl-with-ruby-http-access2.html&quot;&gt;this post&lt;/a&gt; by &lt;a href=&quot;http://ghouston.blogspot.com/&quot;&gt;Greg Houston&lt;/a&gt;.  It turns out that the error is actually raised in the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.openssl.org&quot;&gt;OpenSSL&lt;/a&gt; layer.  It is caused by us trying to verify the server certificate without having the correct trusted root certificate.  It turns out that we can either disable the verification (by using &lt;code&gt;Net::POP3::enable_ssl(OpenSSL::SSL::VERIFY_NONE)&lt;/code&gt;), or we can verify against a trusted root certificate bundle, like the one &lt;a href=&quot;http://curl.haxx.se/docs/caextract.html&quot;&gt;supplied&lt;/a&gt; by cURL.  To verify using the certificate bundle from cURL (or similar), we would amend the above line of code to &lt;code&gt;Net::POP3.enable_ssl(OpenSSL::SSL::VERIFY_PEER, File.dirname(__FILE__) + &#39;/PATH/TO/DOWNLOADED/cacert.pem&#39;)&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I can finally now get on with my rails app to retrieve emails from gmail.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;I&amp;#8217;ve spent a lot more than the intended couple of hours investigating this stuff, yet still have no rails app receiving emails (although I&amp;#8217;m a lot closer now&amp;#8230;)&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;There&amp;#8217;s very little information on the ssl enabled libraries (net/https, net/pop, http-access2 to name but a few) in ruby.  Maybe everybody else just knows about this stuff already, but I&amp;#8217;m certainly pretty unclear.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;I have a feeling that it should be possible to use net/https to connect (unverified) to a site that uses ssl and obtain the certificate for use in subsequent verified connections.  Indeed, another &lt;a href=&quot;http://curl.haxx.se/docs/sslcerts.html&quot;&gt;document&lt;/a&gt; hosted on curl.haxx.se seems to indicate that this is possible.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;I still know very little about ssl and certificates.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;I hope that what little information is here can help someone else in a similar situation.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;</description>

        <title>Boolean method in Ruby (sibling of Array, Float, Integer and String) </title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;I was reading in data from a file and expected one particular column to contain either &amp;#8216;true&amp;#8217; or &amp;#8216;false&amp;#8217;.  I wanted a nice way to convert the string representation into its object counterpart.  I thought to the Kernel#Float (and kin) and decided I wanted a Kernel#Boolean method.  So I made one.  Tada&amp;#8230;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class=&quot;code ruby&quot;&gt;
module Kernel

  def Boolean(string)
    return true if string == true || string =~ /^true$/i
    return false if string == false || string.nil? || string =~ /^false$/i
    raise ArgumentError.new(&quot;invalid value for Boolean: \&quot;#{string}\&quot;&quot;)
  end

end

require File.dirname(__FILE__) + &#39;/../test_helper&#39;

class KernelTest &amp;lt; Test::Unit::TestCase

  def test_should_return_true
    assert_equal true, Boolean(&#39;true&#39;)
    assert_equal true, Boolean(&#39;TrUe&#39;)
    assert_equal true, Boolean(true)
  end

  def test_should_return_false

        <title>Inactive keywords (too high minCpc) when using Google Adwords Api</title>
        <description>&lt;h2&gt;Short version&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;caps&quot;&gt;ALWAYS&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; create adverts (creatives) &lt;strong&gt;before&lt;/strong&gt; keywords when setting up an ad group using the Adwords Api&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Longer version&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our first use of the adwords api was to create around 850 ad groups, each with three text ads and one keyword.  Although the creation seemed to go to plan, a quick inspection in the adwords interface revealed that all of our ads were marked as inactive, with most of our keywords having a minimum bid of ¬£2.50!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Adding the exact same keywords and text ads manually resulted in active keywords, so we knew there was nothing wrong with our content.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A few searches on google didn&amp;#8217;t yield any relevant results, but searching the &lt;a href=&quot;http://groups.google.com/group/adwords-api&quot;&gt;adwords api google group&lt;/a&gt; seemed to reveal other people having the same problem.  The solution was (and is) simple &amp;#8211; ensure that you create your keywords &lt;strong&gt;after&lt;/strong&gt; you&amp;#8217;ve created your ad content.  Indeed, it is impossible to create them in any other order from within the adwords interface itself.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Right now this is just a pain, as it needlessly wastes api quota &amp;#8211; about 700,000 in our case.  Come  &lt;a href=&quot;http://adwordsapi.blogspot.com/2006/09/deadline-for-registration-and-billing.html&quot;&gt;November 1st&lt;/a&gt; this will cost you hard cash &amp;#8211; around ¬£80.00 &amp;#8211; ¬£90 for our 700,000&amp;#8217;ish.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#8217;m hoping google will change their api to warn you when keywords are created before creatives, or, at the very least, make it extremely clear in the docs that there is an order in which the two should be created.  In the meantime, maybe this will help people searching google for an answer to the same problem.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

        <title>Some useful assertions, maybe</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;The first is to ensure two arrays contain the same elements not necessarily in the same order.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class=&quot;code ruby&quot;&gt;
require &#39;test/unit&#39;

require &#39;set&#39;
module AssertEqualArray

  def assert_equal_array(array_1, array_2)
    assert_equal array_1.size, array_2.size, &quot;Arrays must be of the same size to be equal&quot;
    assert_equal array_1.to_set, array_2.to_set
  end

end

class Test::Unit::TestCase
  include AssertEqualArray
end

class MyTest &amp;lt; Test::Unit::TestCase

  def test_should_assert_equal_arrays
    assert_equal_array [1, 2, 3], [2, 1, 3]
  end

end
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The second is to test for generated warnings.  In my &lt;a href=&quot;/blog/2006-10-06-recording-daily-spending-with-a-ruby-dsl&quot;&gt;current project&lt;/a&gt; app, I use method_missing and wanted to warn the user if the unknown message looks like it&amp;#8217;s supposed to be a payment mechanism&amp;#8230;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class=&quot;code ruby&quot;&gt;
day &#39;25-oct-2006&#39; do
  cash 30.29, beer
end

# Results in NoMethodError and, more importantly, this friendly warning..
# Maybe you expected &#39;cash&#39; to be a payment mechanism?
# Cool huh?
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Anyway, I wanted a way to test that the warning was being generated and came up with another assertion&amp;#8230;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class=&quot;code ruby&quot;&gt;
require &#39;test/unit&#39;

require &#39;stringio&#39;
module AssertWarning

  def assert_warning(expected_warning, &amp;amp;blk)
    original_stderr = $stderr
    $stderr = stderr = StringIO.new
    yield
    assert_equal expected_warning, stderr.string.chomp
  ensure
    $stderr = original_stderr
  end

end

class Test::Unit::TestCase
  include AssertWarning
end

class MyTest &amp;lt; Test::Unit::TestCase

  def test_should_assert_warning
    assert_warning(&#39;this is a warning&#39;) { Kernel::warn(&#39;this is a warning&#39;) }
  end

end
&lt;/pre&gt;</description>

        <title>Recording daily spending with a Ruby Dsl</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#8217;m very very very bad with money.  Don&amp;#8217;t get me wrong, I&amp;#8217;m very good at &lt;del&gt;spending&lt;/del&gt; wasting money, just bad at all &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Savings&quot;&gt;the&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Investing&quot;&gt;boring&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pension&quot;&gt;stuff&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The main part of my problem is that I never know how much I have and therefore don&amp;#8217;t know when to stop spending.  This is down to laziness.  It takes time to check balances at a cash point or via my bank&amp;#8217;s website.  I feel that this time can be better spent withdrawing the cash and wandering to the pub.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Anyhoo.  What I really need is a something that illustrates (preferably with big colourful graphs) the amount going out vs the amount coming in.  This needs to be as un-intrusive as possible or I&amp;#8217;m not going to use it.  I&amp;#8217;d also kinda like to see what sort of things I&amp;#8217;m spending on, so that I can maybe shock myself into stopping.  So, I need a record of what I spend my money on.  Enter&amp;#8230; The little dsl to do just that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class=&quot;code ruby&quot;&gt;
payment_mechanisms :cash, :cheque

day &#39;6-oct-2006&#39; do
  cheque 9.99, lunch, &#39;expensivo restaurant&#39;, burger
  cash 4.00, &#39;return ticket&#39;, train
  cash 1.00, &#39;mars bar&#39;, coke
end
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This basically records when and how much I spent, what I spent it on and how I paid for it.  It does nothing more than record at present (and offer some basic addition), but I&amp;#8217;ve got some more ideas.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There&amp;#8217;s also a budgeting counterpart.  The idea being that my colourful graphs can show (very clearly) when I go over budget for a given day/week/month etc.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class=&quot;code ruby&quot;&gt;
weekly do
  outgoing 18.00, lunch
  outgoing 40.00, &#39;train travel&#39;
end

monthly do
  income 1_000_000, &#39;wages (not really my monthly wage)&#39;
  outgoing 500_000, tax
end

yearly do
  outgoing 25.00, &#39;flickr subscription&#39;
end
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That&amp;#8217;s about all I have at the moment.  Unfortunately, I&amp;#8217;m already getting a bit bored with this project so this may be the last of it and I&amp;#8217;ll continue spending over my limits.  Or, I&amp;#8217;ll get those colourful graphs added and it&amp;#8217;ll be heralded as the best budgeting app in the world ever&lt;sup class=&quot;footnote&quot; id=&quot;fnr1&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn1&quot;&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;footnote&quot; id=&quot;fn1&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fnr1&quot;&gt;&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/a&gt; This reminds me of the &amp;#8216;best [dance|rock|urban|insert music genre here] album in the world ever&amp;#8230;&amp;#8217; type compilations, of which &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.amazon.co.uk/Worst-Album-World-Ever-Ever-Shirehorses/dp/B000024V87&quot;&gt;this&lt;/a&gt; is undoubtedly the best.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

        <title>Testing against the (Garbage Collection) Clock, or, Don't create your Test Cases as anonymous classes</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;I &lt;a href=&quot;/blog/2006-07-17-some-realisations-about-testing&quot;&gt;wrote&lt;/a&gt; a while ago about how I&amp;#8217;d started creating my test cases as anonymous classes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I continued this practice until I was slapped in the face by my own stoopidity yesterday.  We were seeing a problem where tests were failing individually but appearing to run fine in rake.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://blog.floehopper.org&quot;&gt;James&lt;/a&gt; was looking into it&amp;#8230;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;
James: it seems like the ones defined by Class.new(Test::Unit::TestCase) aren&#39;t always being found in the ObjectSpace
James: but I can&#39;t quite work out why
James: i&#39;m tempted to name them all as defined classes
Chris: oh ok
Chris: go for it
James: i&#39;m pretty sure that works ok
Chris: interesting
James: only difference i can think of is that if the file is loaded twice you will create two instances of the anonymous class
James: whereas with the named class it will just reopen same class
Chris: why would that be a problem?
James: but it doens&#39;t look like its being loaded twice anyway
James: dunno
James: its the only difference i can think of, but it doesn&#39;t explain anything
James: can you think of any other differences
Chris: so if you create named classes for the testcases in p_l_i_test does it then fail in rake?
James: yup - and i&#39;ve seen the problem in other tests where anonymous tests are defined
James: so there are quite a few tests that haven&#39;t been running in rake
Chris: bugger
Chris: i think ben just explained the problem
James: yeah?
Chris: as the classes aren&#39;t assigned to constants they can be garbage collected
Chris: oops
James: aha
Chris: no more anonymous test classes for christopher
James: that explains - why they were in the ObjectSpace one minute and not the next
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Note that p_l_i_test mentioned above is just a shorthand for one of our tests that was failing individually but &amp;#8216;running&amp;#8217; (or as we now know, not running) from rake.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, although you get a little added excitement to your testing (&amp;#8220;Will this test class run before it gets garbage collected???&amp;#8221;), it&amp;#8217;s probably a lot safer to not use anonymous classes when testing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;James has just informed me that we gained about 230 tests in rake by naming all of our test cases&amp;#8230;&lt;/p&gt;</description>

        <title>Unified method_exists method for ruby</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;There are loads of different ways to check whether an object (class or instance) contains a given method.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In fact, there are so many different ways that I spent some time working out what was what.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I started out testing each of the relevant Module methods on both a class and instance.  This was followed up by testing each of the relevant Object methods on both a class and instance.  The full test suite is &lt;a href=&quot;/pages/20060918_testing_method_responses_full&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I summarised the results into a more compact test suite &lt;a href=&quot;/pages/20060918_testing_method_responses_compact&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I think I&amp;#8217;m correct in stating that there&amp;#8217;s no one way to check for the existence of a method (be it public, protected or private) on a class.  However, the test results make it slightly easier to scan and create such a method &amp;#8211; &lt;a href=&quot;/pages/20060918_testing_class_method_exists&quot;&gt;three variants&lt;/a&gt; none-the-less.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The same statement goes for uniformly determining the existence of a method on an instance.  Once again the tests helped derive the three implementations &lt;a href=&quot;/pages/20060918_testing_instance_method_exists&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Combining these two imlpementations provides us with a uniform method to determine whether the receiver contains a method represented by &lt;em&gt;method_sym&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class=&quot;code ruby&quot;&gt;
class Object
  def method_exists?(method_sym)
    methods = public_methods + protected_methods + private_methods
    methods.include?(method_sym.to_s)
  end
end
class Class
  def method_exists?(method_sym)
    methods = public_instance_methods + protected_instance_methods + private_instance_methods
    methods.include?(method_sym.to_s)
  end
end

class Foo
  def foo; end; public :foo
  def bar; end; protected :bar
  def baz; end; private :baz
end

require &#39;test/unit&#39;

Class.new(Test::Unit::TestCase) do

  def assert_not(expr)
    assert ! expr
  end

  def assert_method_exists_is_working(receiver)
    [:foo, :bar, :baz].each do |sym|
      assert receiver.method_exists?(sym)
      assert receiver.method_exists?(sym.to_s)
    end
    assert_not receiver.method_exists?(:made_up_method)
    assert_not receiver.method_exists?(&#39;made_up_method&#39;)
  end

  def test_class
    assert_method_exists_is_working(Foo)
  end

  def test_instance
    assert_method_exists_is_working(Foo.new)
  end

end
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What&amp;#8217;s the point you ask?  I genuinely have no idea.  I&amp;#8217;m sure there was one when I started but then my compulsiveness took over and I had to finish for no other reason than to finish.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

        <title>gDisk - very cheap (free) online storage</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#8217;ve used &lt;a href=&quot;http://gdisk.sourceforge.net/&quot;&gt;this&lt;/a&gt; for a while but haven&amp;#8217;t got round to mentioning it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Basically, it uses a &lt;a href=&quot;http://mail.google.com&quot;&gt;gmail&lt;/a&gt; account (curently offering around 2.7GB space) as online storage, accessed seamlessly from this app.  Mac Os X only I&amp;#8217;m afraid although I&amp;#8217;m sure I&amp;#8217;ve heard of Windows alternatives.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#8217;m not sure if gmail is still invite only, but if it is, and if someone reading doesn&amp;#8217;t have a gmail account, let me know as I have plenty of invites.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

        <title>In memory AR object for testing</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#8217;ve &lt;a href=&quot;/blog/2006-07-12-using-in-memory-active-record-objects-with-associations-for-testing&quot;&gt;previously written&lt;/a&gt; about using in memory active record objects for testing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In doing so recently, I&amp;#8217;ve found it necessary to define the id of the in memory object.  By default this is obviously nil as it has not been persisted.  In addition, it is not possible to set it during normal object construction.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class=&quot;code ruby&quot;&gt;
person = Person.new(:id =&amp;gt; 1)
p person.id
#=&amp;gt; nil
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, we can give the person constructor a block, setting the id just after creation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class=&quot;code ruby&quot;&gt;
person = Person.new { |p| p.id = 1 }
p person.id
#=&amp;gt; 1
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Cool.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

        <title>Recommended web host</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;I can&amp;#8217;t recommend &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.asmallorange.com&quot;&gt;A Small Orange&lt;/a&gt; enough.  They offer very competitive shared hosting and don&amp;#8217;t charge for &amp;#8220;upgrades&amp;#8221; like the majority of hosts.  From their site..&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Many hosts put artificial limits on what you can do in order to force you to upgrade your account, just so you will buy that one extra MySQL database or extra email account you need. At A Small Orange, we don&amp;#8217;t believe in artificial limitations so we offer the following unlimited features on all our hosting accounts:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Unlimited POP3/&lt;span class=&quot;caps&quot;&gt;IMAP&lt;/span&gt; Mail Accounts&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Unlimited MySQL Databases&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Unlimited Mailing Lists&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Unlimited Email Forwarders&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Unlimited Subdomains&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Unlimited Parked and Addon Domains&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Unlimited &lt;span class=&quot;caps&quot;&gt;FTP&lt;/span&gt; Accounts&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have been offering web and email hosting for a couple of local firms (harking back to me self-[un]employed days).  I wanted to get them moved to someone else (to relieve me of the burden) but felt responsible for getting them a good deal.  They only have small static sites so I was reluctant to pay for expensive hosting that offered unnecessary features.  I found &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.dataflame.co.uk&quot;&gt;dataflame&lt;/a&gt; to be relatively cheap.  Unfortunately the &amp;#8216;cheapness&amp;#8217; soon disappears once we look at &amp;#8216;upgrading&amp;#8217; our account with such &amp;#8216;features&amp;#8217; as parked domains.  In fairness, most hosts seem to charge for these automated extras, making me very happy to discover &lt;span class=&quot;caps&quot;&gt;ASO&lt;/span&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#8217;ve moved the accounts over to &lt;span class=&quot;caps&quot;&gt;ASO&lt;/span&gt; and have had no problems to date.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I actually had reason to contact &lt;span class=&quot;caps&quot;&gt;ASO&lt;/span&gt; yesterday (enable ssh access and one other matter).  Ssh access was configured within five minutes of my sending the email.  The other matter was resolved within one hour.  That&amp;#8217;s some good supportin&amp;#8217; they got goin&amp;#8217; on.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They also boast &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.rubyonrails.com&quot;&gt;rails&lt;/a&gt; support but I haven&amp;#8217;t got round to testing this yet.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In fairness, I actually moved hosting for one of the firms to &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.bluehost.com&quot;&gt;bluehost&lt;/a&gt; originally.  These guys also offer great rates and features (not quite as great as &lt;span class=&quot;caps&quot;&gt;ASO&lt;/span&gt;).  We just had one problem &amp;#8211; there are consistent network failures between us (at least parts of the UK) and them (somewhere in the States).  They can see the problem but as it lies with one of their upstream providers apparently there is not much they can do about it.  Hmmm.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That&amp;#8217;s enough praising for now.  Go &lt;span class=&quot;caps&quot;&gt;ASO&lt;/span&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

        <title>Textmate environment and ruby (again)</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#8217;ve recently upgraded the version of ruby on my machine and came up against problems similar to &lt;a href=&quot;/blog/2006-07-28-textmate-and-env-ruby-no-such-file-or-directory&quot;&gt;this&lt;/a&gt;.  The problem previously was that &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.macromates.com&quot;&gt;textmate&lt;/a&gt; wasn&amp;#8217;t finding &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.ruby-lang.org&quot;&gt;ruby&lt;/a&gt; at all.  This time, textmate was finding the wrong version of ruby.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I found the following script useful in determining exactly which ruby binary textmate was using.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class=&quot;code ruby&quot;&gt;
#!/usr/bin/env ruby

require &#39;rbconfig&#39;
puts Config::CONFIG[&#39;bindir&#39;]
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Simply paste that into a textmate document, select it and hit Ctrl-r.  The path of the ruby binary should print right there in the window.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To see far more info than you&amp;#8217;ll ever likely need, replace the line starting &lt;code&gt;puts&lt;/code&gt; above, with the following..&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class=&quot;code ruby&quot;&gt;
Config::CONFIG.sort.each do |key, value|
  puts &quot;#{key} = #{value}&quot;
end
&lt;/pre&gt;</description>

        <title>Rails leaking some strings in development</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;I spent some time this morning checking out &lt;a href=&quot;http://scottstuff.net/blog/&quot;&gt;Scott Laird&amp;#8217;s&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;http://scottstuff.net/blog/articles/2006/08/17/memory-leak-profiling-with-rails&quot;&gt;memory profiler&lt;/a&gt; against a fresh rails app.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I was suprised to see that around 110 strings were being leaked on each request.  I was incredibly surprised when I used the string_debug option (to the memory profiler) to generate logs of strings living in ObjectSpace.  There were strings appearing that I &lt;em&gt;knew&lt;/em&gt; were not in my new rails app anywhere.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After grepping my working directory for some of these strings (and not coming up with anything), &lt;a href=&quot;http://blog.floehopper.org&quot;&gt;James&lt;/a&gt; suggested that the strings could be in my irb history.  Although it wasn&amp;#8217;t immediately obvious how they were appearing, the strings were indeed in my history (just over 100 lines worth.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A little inspection and the culprit was found.  The &lt;a href=&quot;http://api.rubyonrails.com/classes/Breakpoint.html&quot;&gt;rails breakpoint library&lt;/a&gt; requires irb, which loads the irb_history.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In summary: the contents of irb_history are loaded into object space on each request made to your rails app, while in development.  These strings do not appear to get garbage collected.  The problem does not affect apps running in production as the breakpoint library is not loaded in that environment.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

        <title>Feed reading feature requests</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;A bit of an unordered list of features I&amp;#8217;d like to see in a feed reader.  It&amp;#8217;s very possible these exist in some readers that I&amp;#8217;m not aware of (I&amp;#8217;ve moved from &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.sharpreader.net/&quot;&gt;desktop app on windows&lt;/a&gt; through &lt;a href=&quot;http://bloglines.com/&quot;&gt;bloglines&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.rojo.com&quot;&gt;rojo&lt;/a&gt; to &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.feedshow.com&quot;&gt;feedshow&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Comment from within the reader.  This would then automatically subscribe to a feed of the comments so that I could poll the updates.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Notify me when feeds haven&amp;#8217;t been accessible for a while.  Maybe the address has changed or the reader cannot interpret the feed correctly; either way, I&amp;#8217;d like to know so that I can make an informed decision about what to do.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;When a page offers multiple feed formats, I don&amp;#8217;t want to be asked what format to subscribe to.  The program should know the format it supports best and choose that.  As I type this, I&amp;#8217;m thinking that this is more difficult if there is a choice between full and summary content.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;If an existing article is &amp;#8216;refreshed&amp;#8217; then diff it.  If it hasn&amp;#8217;t changed then I don&amp;#8217;t want to see it.  If it has changed, then highlight the changes for me.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Show html in articles sensibly (rojo seemed to fail miserably on this front).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Host a &amp;#8216;live&amp;#8217; (i.e. dynamically generated copy of my feeds in opml) &amp;#8211; I can&amp;#8217;t think of any reason to have to import/export these.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;</description>

        <title>I hope I didn't break rubyforge...</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;A couple of days ago I was playing around with &lt;a href=&quot;http://search.cpan.org/~clkao/SVN-Mirror-0.68/lib/SVN/Mirror.pm&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;caps&quot;&gt;SVN&lt;/span&gt;::Mirror&lt;/a&gt;, trying to remove some &lt;a href=&quot;http://wiki.rubyonrails.org/rails/pages/Plugins&quot;&gt;dependencies&lt;/a&gt; on third party repositories not in our control.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All was going well until I tried to mirror a &lt;a href=&quot;http://rubyforge.org/projects/mocha/&quot;&gt;project&lt;/a&gt; hosted on rubyforge.  On initialising the mirror, I kept receiving the error &amp;#8220;source url not under source root&amp;#8221; from line 72 in Ra.pm.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After some very careful debugging (yeah, like I know anything about perl &amp;#8211; &lt;code&gt;print &quot;1&quot;;&lt;/code&gt; was about the extent of it) of that perl file; I noticed that the $source_root variable didn&amp;#8217;t contain the double slash&lt;sup class=&quot;footnote&quot; id=&quot;fnr1&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn1&quot;&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;.  This causes a problem for the line &lt;code&gt;if substr($path, 0, length($source_root), &#39;&#39;) ne $source_root;&lt;/code&gt; as at this point, $path does contain the double slash.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The value of $source_root is returned from a call to RA&amp;#8594;get_repos_root (Subversion Repository Access code).  So; it would seem that the url was being normalised somewhere in the bowels of &lt;a href=&quot;http://subversion.tigris.org&quot;&gt;Subversion&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This was kinda confirmed by testing the svn client (which uses the code in the RA module just like &lt;span class=&quot;caps&quot;&gt;SVN&lt;/span&gt;::Mirror) with urls containing additional slashes.  The url was always resolved and svn info would always show the normalised variant.  It was additionally(ish) tested by using the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.ruby-lang.org&quot;&gt;Ruby&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;http://svn.collab.net/viewvc/svn/trunk/subversion/bindings/swig/ruby/&quot;&gt;bindings&lt;/a&gt; (which, as an aside, contain just about the most difficult to read Ruby code I&amp;#8217;ve ever come across!)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I would love to have followed the actual subversion c code to find the normalisation routine but I&amp;#8217;m sadly not clever enough; so my findings had to suffice.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Anyhoo, the outcome of the story is that I emailed Tom Copeland of rubyforge fame to ask about the deal with the double slashes.  Turns out that it was probably just a &lt;a href=&quot;http://gforge.org/&quot;&gt;gforge&lt;/a&gt; default thing and Tom went ahead and promptly changed it.  I suddenly got very nervous that lots of arms would be thrown up with cries of &amp;#8220;Who broke rubyforge?&amp;#8221;, but so far it would appears to be ok.  Phew.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;footnote&quot; id=&quot;fn1&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fnr1&quot;&gt;&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/a&gt; Not sure if anyone else had really noticed but the svn repositories on rubyforge used to contain a double slash between the domain and var path (i.e. rubyforge.org//var).&lt;/p&gt;</description>

        <title>Tickling link_to into submission</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;What a crappy title.  Ho hum.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This bit explains the itch I had.  Skip over it if you like.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I recently finished re-structuring some of the code at &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.reevoo.com&quot;&gt;work&lt;/a&gt;, in which I namespaced all of the admin type controllers.  At the same time, I attempted to split some of the larger, confused (about their responsibilities) controllers into smaller chunks.  This all seems to have worked quite well, but we&amp;#8217;ve ended up with some naff (I haven&amp;#8217;t used that word in ages) action names.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I like, where possible, to follow the scaffold naming convention (list, show, new, create, edit, update and destroy); and so went ahead and started changing things.  I was writing my tests like mum always said I should&lt;sup class=&quot;footnote&quot; id=&quot;fnr1&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn1&quot;&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; when I realised that there was a bit missing (uh oh).  You see, I was ensuring that my controllers responded to certain actions; and I was also ensuring that my views had links to certain controllers and actions.  The missing link was a check as to whether the links in my views went to valid controller actions.  I could, for example, have been testing for a link to /foo/edit in my view but for an edit_foo action in my foo_controller test.  Both tests would pass, but the application would still be broken.  Not cool.  We do actually have &lt;a href=&quot;http://openqa.org/selenium&quot;&gt;something&lt;/a&gt; in place to perform these tests but I&amp;#8217;m still a bit scared of selenium and don&amp;#8217;t use it as much as I should.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Anyway, i started thinking about bending the &lt;a href=&quot;http://api.rubyonrails.com/classes/ActionView/Helpers/UrlHelper.html#M000378&quot;&gt;link_to&lt;/a&gt; helper to my will.  I figured that the little fella was a good candidate to not only give me a perfectly formed chunk of html goodness; but to also tell me whether the said chunk of html goodness was actually going to work (i.e. whether my app responded to the generated url).  Cool idea huh.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#8217;m getting tired and a little bored now so I&amp;#8217;ll wrap this post up.  I&amp;#8217;ve created a &lt;a href=&quot;http://chrisroos.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/plugins/action_view_helper_url_helper/&quot;&gt;plugin&lt;/a&gt; (svn co http://chrisroos.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/plugins/action_view_helper_url_helper/) that replaces the link_to method to add a class attribute (invalid_href_target or valid_href_target) to the generated anchor tag.  You could then use the assert_no_broken_links assertion to ensure there are no anchors with a class of invalid_href_target in your views; and/or you could style it (see resource/style.css as an example) so that you can see any broken links at a glance whilst in development (as shown in the image below).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://farm1.static.flickr.com/192/460075342_987c127e66_o.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The code is pretty poor/naive, works with rails 1.0.0 (hence my trying to &lt;a href=&quot;/blog/2006-08-14-create-rails-projects-using-a-specific-rails-gem-version&quot;&gt;set-up a rails 1.0.0 app&lt;/a&gt; earlier), doesn&amp;#8217;t work with rails 1.1.6 (not sure about versions in between) and may or may not work for you.  I kinda think it&amp;#8217;s a good idea but there&amp;#8217;s every chance that a) it&amp;#8217;s not or b) there&amp;#8217;s already a simple solution to this problem.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let me know how you get on if you decide to risk the health of your project by trying this plugin.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;footnote&quot; id=&quot;fn1&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fnr1&quot;&gt;&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/a&gt; She didn&amp;#8217;t say that.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

        <title>Create rails projects using a specific rails gem version</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;I just found this when trying to create a rails project using rails 1.0.0 (having both 1.0.0 and 1.1.6 installed as gems).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If the first argument to the rails command is a valid (i.e. installed) version number and surrounded by underscores then that version of the gem is used to create the rails application structure.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So (with 1.0.0 and 1.1.6 gems installed)..&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class=&quot;code shell&quot;&gt;
$ rails _1.0.0_ my-rails-proj
#-&amp;gt; uses rails version 1

$ rails my-rails-proj
#-&amp;gt; uses latest rails version (1.1.6)
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Although you can normally place the rails libraries into the vendor directory of a given rails app (to use that specific rails version); I had problems when placing rails 1.0.0 into a rails 1.1.6 generated app.  An error is encountered when trying to boot webrick..&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class=&quot;code&quot;&gt;
./script/../config/../vendor/rails/railties/lib/initializer.rb:256:in `send&#39;: undefined method `cache_template_extensions=&#39; for ActionView::Base:Class (NoMethodError)
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By passing the version argument to the rails command and then placing rails 1.0.0 into the vendor directory, everything works as expected.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

        <title>Helpful error messages when active record objects fail validation (in tests)</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;I &lt;a href=&quot;/blog/2006-06-21-more-helpful-messages-for-active-record-validation-errors-in-rails-testing&quot;&gt;posted&lt;/a&gt; a while back about displaying the reasons for an active record model failing validation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I knew the code was hacky and nasty but didn&amp;#8217;t realise quite how bad until I noticed how &lt;a href=&quot;http://dev.rubyonrails.org/browser/tags/rel_1-1-0/activerecord/lib/active_record/validations.rb&quot;&gt;simply&lt;/a&gt;  (1 line) the same thing was implemented in &lt;a href=&quot;http://weblog.rubyonrails.com/2006/3/28/rails-1-1-rjs-active-record-respond_to-integration-tests-and-500-other-things&quot;&gt;Rails 1.1&lt;/a&gt; (and above).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Although it&amp;#8217;s only useful for people still on Rails 1.0, I made a quick plugin that backports this change.  I don&amp;#8217;t really want to put it in my subversion repository, so have just pasted the necessary code below.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class=&quot;code ruby&quot;&gt;
# File init.rb
require File.dirname(__FILE__) + &#39;/lib/record_invalid&#39;
&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;pre class=&quot;code ruby&quot;&gt;
# File record_invalid.rb
module ActiveRecord

  class RecordInvalid &amp;lt; ActiveRecordError
    def initialize(record)
      @record = record
      super(&quot;Validation failed: #{@record.errors.full_messages.join(&quot;, &quot;)}&quot;)
    end
  end

end
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To create a plugin from this, create the following structure in your rails_app/vendor/plugins directory.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class=&quot;code&quot;&gt;
active_record_validation_error/
|
|--init.rb (copy contents of code above)
|
|--lib/
   |
   |--record_invalid.rb (copy content of code above)
&lt;/pre&gt;</description>

        <title>TextMate and env: ruby: No such file or directory</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;So, I was coming up against this problem in TextMate just recently.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#8217;s a bit of a strange error in that you get seemingly conflicting output from TextMate.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In a new TextMate document, I could run (by using the well handy, and very new to me, Ctrl-r key combo)..&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class=&quot;code&quot;&gt;
$ /usr/bin/env ruby --version
=&amp;gt; ruby 1.8.4 (2005-12-24) [i686-darwin8.7.1]

$ /usr/bin/which ruby
=&amp;gt; /usr/local/bin/ruby

#!/usr/local/bin/ruby

puts &quot;hello world&quot;
=&amp;gt; hello world
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, if I ran..&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class=&quot;code&quot;&gt;
#!/usr/bin/env ruby

puts &quot;hello world again&quot;
=&amp;gt; env: ruby: No such file or directory
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hmm, so &lt;code&gt;/usr/bin/env ruby --version&lt;/code&gt; works, but when using the very same as the shebang interpreter we get an error.  Odd huh.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Well, apparently not; if we read the textmate docs about &lt;a href=&quot;http://macromates.com/textmate/manual/shell_commands#search_path&quot;&gt;shell commands&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Although I, in no way, understand this completely; I blindly followed the instructions on that page and got TextMate back to health.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In summary for those that don&amp;#8217;t wish to read the docs..&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class=&quot;code&quot;&gt;
$ mkdir ~/.MacOSX/
$ cat &amp;gt;&amp;gt; ~/.MacOSX/environment.plist
{ PATH = &quot;/usr/local/bin&quot;; }
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Note&lt;/strong&gt; You&amp;#8217;ll want to change the path to the location of the binaries you want found.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then a quick log out and back in, and all is well with TextMate.  Yay.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

        <title>Test::Unit abstract test case</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;Having found a &lt;a href=&quot;/blog/2006-07-17-some-realisations-about-testing&quot;&gt;new way to structure my tests&lt;/a&gt;, the need for some common setup shared by multiple test cases became apparent.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I think the traditional way to do this was to create a subclass of TestCase to contain the common setup code and then subclass that for your individual test cases.  This is fine, but in &lt;a href=&quot;http://ruby-doc.org/stdlib/libdoc/test/unit/rdoc/index.html&quot;&gt;test/unit&lt;/a&gt;, a TestCase with no tests causes an error.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One solution would be to use a module to contain the common setup and include that in your test case.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class=&quot;code ruby&quot;&gt;
module CommonSetup
  def setup
    @stack = Stack.new
  end
end
class MyTest &amp;lt; Test::Unit::TestCase
  include CommonSetup
  def test_should_accept_an_item_when_sent_push
    assert_nothing_raised { @stack.push(1) }
  end
end
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Although this is fine, I spent a short while creating an AbstractTestCase that doesn&amp;#8217;t complain if no tests are specified.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class=&quot;code ruby&quot;&gt;
require &#39;test/unit&#39;
class Test::Unit::AbstractTestCase &amp;lt; Test::Unit::TestCase
  def default_test
    klass = self.class.to_s
    ancestors = (self.class.ancestors - [self.class]).collect { |ancestor| ancestor.to_s }
    super unless klass =~ /AbstractTestCase/ or ancestors.first =~ /AbstractTestCase/
  end
end
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Any test case (TestBase in this example) that inherits from AbstractTestCase can now contain setup and teardown methods but not have to worry about missing tests.  In order to maintain expected behaviour, any test case subclassed from TestBase will still complain if tests are missing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class=&quot;code ruby&quot;&gt;
class TestBase &amp;lt; Test::Unit::AbstractTestCase
  # &#39;No test were specified&#39; error is not thrown
  def setup
    @bar = { :foo =&amp;gt; 123 }
  end
end
class RealTest &amp;lt; TestBase
  # Utilises TestBase#setup
  def test_example
    assert_equal 123, @bar[:foo]
  end
end
class ShouldErrorTest &amp;lt; TestBase
  # &#39;No tests were specified&#39; error
end
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I then figured that you may want more than one level of abstract test case, i.e. be able to define at the TestCase class level whether or not a test case was abstract.  This isn&amp;#8217;t properly tested but it seems to work ok.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Note&lt;/strong&gt; This isn&amp;#8217;t doing exactly what I thought (the default test case is default_test, not test_default).  This works because it just creates an empty test in your test case.  This breaks behaviour in test cases that subclass your abstract test case as they too will already have at least one test defined.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class=&quot;code ruby&quot;&gt;
require &#39;test/unit&#39;
class Test::Unit::TestCase
  class &amp;lt;&amp;lt; self
    def abstract
      self.class_eval do
        def test_default
        end
      end
    end
  end
end
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By sending the abstract message to any TestCase class, no errors will be reported when no tests are specified.  It does this by overriding the test_default method; which is the method that raises the error if no other tests are specified.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class=&quot;code ruby&quot;&gt;
class AbstractTest &amp;lt; Test::Unit::TestCase
  abstract
  # &#39;No test were specified&#39; error is not thrown
end
class NormalTest &amp;lt; Test::Unit::TestCase
  # &#39;No test were specified&#39; error
end
&lt;/pre&gt;</description>

        <title>Some realisations about testing</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;Having been predominantly involved in &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.rubyonrails.com&quot;&gt;Rails&lt;/a&gt; development just recently, &lt;a href=&quot;http://api.rubyonrails.com/classes/Fixtures.html&quot;&gt;fixtures&lt;/a&gt; have taken on a slightly different meaning to what I now believe to be the original understanding.  Having recently re-read &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.amazon.co.uk/gp/product/0321146530/202-8808398-1811851?v=glance&amp;amp;n=266239&quot;&gt;Test Driven Development: By Example&lt;/a&gt; I re-discovered the &amp;#8216;original&amp;#8217; meaning of the word (essentially shared objects used by all tests in a test case).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This has made me think about the way that I&amp;#8217;ve been structuring my tests (or not structuring them as the case may be).  I have never been a fan of the setup and teardown methods provided to us in &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/XUnit&quot;&gt;xUnit&lt;/a&gt; and I now believe this to be due to my misunderstanding of the term fixture and therefore their intention.  This has led to my test cases growing very large and containing many disparate tests.  If there was any separation of the testcase then it was usually based on functionality of a particular method (which separately leads me to believe that they may have been better expressed in a new object).  I now understand that test cases should be split to contain tests that rely on a common test fixture.  As soon as I started to do this, the setup and (to a lesser degree) teardown methods have become much more useful.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#8217;ve also started to create my test cases as anonymous classes derived from Test::Unit::TestCase.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class=&quot;code ruby&quot;&gt;
Class.new(Test::Unit::TestCase) do
  def test_
    assert true
  end
end
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I find that this helps when trying to determine where a new test should be placed.  If the class has a name I&amp;#8217;m tempted to scan that and make a decision as to whether a new test belongs in this case.  By keeping them anonymous, I have to inspect the test fixture in order to understand whether a new test belongs here.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Note&lt;/strong&gt; I may also add a comment right below Class.new to explicitly specify the fixture for this testcase.  This may seem to go against not naming the classes in the first place but I think part of the problem with class names is the lack of punctuation and therefore the difficulty in clearly expressing the test fixture.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#8217;ve chosen a somewhat contrived example to demonstrate my new found test structure.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class=&quot;code ruby&quot;&gt;
Class.new(Test::Unit::TestCase) do
  # An empty stack

  def setup
    @stack = Stack.new
  end

  def test_should_accept_an_item_when_sent_push
    assert_nothing_raised { @stack.push(1) }
  end

  def test_should_complain_when_sent_top
    assert_raise(StackUnderflowError) { @stack.top }
  end

  def test_should_complain_when_sent_pop
    assert_raise(StackUnderflowError) { @stack.pop }
  end

end
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The fixture for this test is an empty stack.  The individual tests prod and query the empty stack to ensure that it behaves as expected.  Although the example above is incredibly simple, I have consistently found that my individual test methods become much smaller.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Notice that the names of the tests all start &amp;#8216;test_should&amp;#8217;.  Not only does this help us think about the responsibilities of the object; but it enables us to maintain living system specifications based on the tests.  I believe this idea first came from &lt;a href=&quot;http://agiledox.sourceforge.net/index.html&quot;&gt;testdox for Java&lt;/a&gt; but was introduced to me by &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.reevoo.com/blogs/bengriffiths/&quot;&gt;Ben&lt;/a&gt; at &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.reevoo.com&quot;&gt;work&lt;/a&gt;.  In fact Ben has written a cool &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.reevoo.com/blogs/bengriffiths/2006/04/05/rails-agiledox-browser/&quot;&gt;Agiledox server&lt;/a&gt; that displays the system specifications for your rails project.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The realisations set out above have come at around the same time as my taking more of an interest in &lt;a href=&quot;http://rspec.rubyforge.org/&quot;&gt;rSpec&lt;/a&gt; (the stack test above has been adapted directly from one of the rSpec examples); a &lt;a href=&quot;http://behaviour-driven.org/&quot;&gt;behaviour driven development&lt;/a&gt; framework for &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.ruby-lang.org&quot;&gt;ruby&lt;/a&gt;.  I haven&amp;#8217;t done any real work with rSpec yet but am hoping it might improve the way I think of both testing and OO design in general.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

        <title>Textmate command to display Active Record column attributes</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;I find myself constantly visiting either the console or the mysql command line to check out the attributes (columns) of &lt;a href=&quot;http://api.rubyonrails.com/classes/ActiveRecord/Base.html&quot;&gt;active record&lt;/a&gt; objects.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I know there is a &lt;a href=&quot;http://blogs.pragprog.com/cgi-bin/pragdave.cgi/Tech/Ruby/AnnotateModels.rdoc&quot;&gt;plugin&lt;/a&gt; by &lt;a href=&quot;http://blogs.pragprog.com/cgi-bin/pragdave.cgi&quot;&gt;Dave Thomas&lt;/a&gt; that places the table structure within the model code itself.  To be honest I&amp;#8217;ve never tried this and it might well suffice (although I&amp;#8217;m not 100% convinced I like the idea).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Anyhoo, I just spent some time whilst on the train hacking together a basic &lt;a href=&quot;http://macromates.com/&quot;&gt;textmate&lt;/a&gt; command that displays a tooltip containing the table structure.  It&amp;#8217;s very basic (though you wouldn&amp;#8217;t have thought it based on the amount of time it took me together&lt;sup class=&quot;footnote&quot; id=&quot;fnr1&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn1&quot;&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;); but seems to work ok.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://farm1.static.flickr.com/236/460082493_49ff4cd1ed_o.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The code is below.  You&amp;#8217;ll need to add a ruby command in the ruby textmate bundle, setting the intput to &amp;#8216;selected text&amp;#8217; or &amp;#8216;nothing&amp;#8217;, the output to &amp;#8216;show as tooltip&amp;#8217; and preferably a hotkey that isn&amp;#8217;t one of the ones you use every day (however tempting that is).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class=&quot;code ruby&quot;&gt;
#! /usr/local/bin/ruby

project = ENV[&#39;TM_PROJECT_DIRECTORY&#39;]
word = ENV[&#39;TM_CURRENT_WORD&#39;]

require &quot;#{project}/config/boot&quot;
require &quot;#{project}/config/environment&quot;

klass = Object.const_get(word) rescue nil
if klass and klass.class == Class and klass.ancestors.include?(ActiveRecord::Base)
  columns = klass.columns_hash

  data = []
  data += [%w[column primary sql_type default]]
  data += [%w[------ ------- -------- -------]]
  data += columns.collect { |col, attrs| [col, attrs.primary.to_s, attrs.sql_type.to_s, attrs.default.to_s] }

  STDOUT &amp;lt;&amp;lt; data.inject(&#39;&#39;) do |output, array|
    output + array.inject(&#39;&#39;) { |row_str, value| row_str + value.ljust(20) } + &quot;\n&quot;
  end
elsif klass and klass.class == Class and not klass.ancestors.include?(ActiveRecord::Base)
  STDOUT &amp;lt;&amp;lt; &quot;#{word} is not an Active Record derived class&quot;
else
  STDOUT &amp;lt;&amp;lt; &quot;#{word} was not recognised as a class&quot;
end
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It relies on you having your entire rails project (the folder right above app, config, script etc) open in textmate (in order to find the config files).  With that, just click on the name of an active record class (it has to be the actual class name at present, it&amp;#8217;d be cool if it also worked based on the class definition you are currently in too) and hit your hotkey of choice (best to use the one you assigned to this command).  Hey presto, a tooltip containing your table structure.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One odd thing I&amp;#8217;ve noticed is that it never recognises standard class constants.  It should display &amp;#8216;this is not an active record derived class&amp;#8217; but instead always displays &amp;#8216;was not recognised as a class&amp;#8217;.  Oh well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Anyone find this remotely useful or want to finish off what I&amp;#8217;ve started?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;footnote&quot; id=&quot;fn1&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fnr1&quot;&gt;&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/a&gt; I spent ages trying to develop within the textmate bundle editor before realising it&amp;#8217;d be a helluva lot quicker and easier to develop in textmate proper.  Hmmm.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

        <title>Using in memory Active Record objects with associations for testing</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;Hitting the database in testing is bad.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Something that I&amp;#8217;ve found relatively useful at &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.reevoo.com&quot;&gt;work&lt;/a&gt; is to use real &lt;a href=&quot;http://api.rubyonrails.com/classes/ActiveRecord/Base.html&quot;&gt;Active Record&lt;/a&gt; objects without any persistence (basically use AR#new and not AR#save[!] or AR#create[!]).  When using standard techniques to create the association objects in memory you only get one side of the association at a time.  Consider the following.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class=&quot;code ruby&quot;&gt;
class Person &amp;lt; ActiveRecord::Base
  has_many :addresses
end
class Address &amp;lt; ActiveRecord::Base
  belongs_to :person
end

# One sided relationship with parent getting access to child
chris = Person.new
home = chris.addresses.build

chris.addresses.first
=&amp;gt; #&amp;lt;home&amp;gt;
home.person
=&amp;gt; nil

# One sided relationship with child getting access to parent
home = Address.new
chris = home.build_person

chris.addresses
=&amp;gt; []
home.person
=&amp;gt; #&amp;lt;chris&amp;gt;

# The example above that creates the address first could also have been written as.
# chris = Person.new
# home = Address.new(:person =&amp;gt; chris)
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You can see that in each case, only one side of the relationship has access to the other.  If we were persisting the objects then the relationship would be two way via a database lookup.  We can get a two way relationship in memory; although it has a certain duplication smell about it.  Assuming the same models as above, we can amend the above examples like so.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class=&quot;code ruby&quot;&gt;
# First example
chris = Person.new
home = chris.addresses.build(:person =&amp;gt; chris)

chris.addresses.first
=&amp;gt; #&amp;lt;home&amp;gt;
home.person
=&amp;gt; #&amp;lt;chris&amp;gt;

# Second example
home = Address.new
chris = home.build_person(:addresses =&amp;gt; [home])

home.person
=&amp;gt; #&amp;lt;chris&amp;gt;
chris.addresses.first
=&amp;gt; #&amp;lt;home&amp;gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#8217;ve occasionally used this in place of stubbing methods but am still not 100% convinced of the definite benefits one way or another.  I do have some definite disadvantages of stubbing methods (nothing exciting, they&amp;#8217;ve almost certainly been noted by many others in the past) which I&amp;#8217;ll note down at a later date.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

        <title>Ruby hashes with default values</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;I found that on several occasions I&amp;#8217;ve wanted to create a hash that increments the number of instances of a given key.  We could do something manual like.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class=&quot;code ruby&quot;&gt;
hash = Hash.new
def increment_count(hash, key)
  hash[key] ||= 0 # Sets any new keys to 0.
  hash[key] += 1
end
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is fine; but can be written more concisely.  If we supply an object to Hash::new then that object becomes the default value for all missing keys in the hash.  The above example is shortened by one line.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class=&quot;code ruby&quot;&gt;
hash = Hash.new(0)
def increment_count(hash, key)
  hash[key] += 1
end
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A problem arises when we want to use an object that isn&amp;#8217;t immutable (in this case, basically anything other than a Fixnum) as the default value.  The example that I came across a couple of times today was using an empty array as the default value.  If we try to use the same method as above, we experience problems.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class=&quot;code ruby&quot;&gt;
hash = Hash.new(Array.new)
hash[:key_one]
=&amp;gt; []
hash[:key_two] &amp;lt;&amp;lt; 99
=&amp;gt; [99]
hash[:key_one]
=&amp;gt; [99] # is actually the same array amended in the step above
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#8217;ve known that there was a way around this for a long time but have never bothered to look it up.  I finally got round to looking at it today, and it is, unsurprisingly, very simple.  We supply the hash constructor with a block.  This block is called for any missing key and supplied with the hash and said key.  The example above becomes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class=&quot;code ruby&quot;&gt;
hash = Hash.new { |hash, key| hash[key] = Array.new }
hash[:key_one]
=&amp;gt; []
hash[:key_two] &amp;lt;&amp;lt; 99
=&amp;gt; [99]
hash[:key_one]
=&amp;gt; []
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I say I looked it up today but to be fair there&amp;#8217;s every chance that I was well aware of this at some point in the past&amp;#8230;&lt;/p&gt;</description>

        <title>Trying to learn</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#8217;ve decided I&amp;#8217;m going to attempt to write down some things that I learn about ruby.  I &amp;#8216;learn&amp;#8217; the same stuff all the time due to the nature of my very bad memory.  In an attempt to learn some things just the once I&amp;#8217;m going to try write them down.  It probably wont help.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

        <title>Very very lightweight mocking(ish)</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.floehopper.org/&quot;&gt;James&lt;/a&gt; has been developing a great &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.martinfowler.com/articles/mocksArentStubs.html&quot;&gt;mocking&lt;/a&gt; framework at &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.reevoo.com&quot;&gt;work&lt;/a&gt; which makes life real easy when it comes to testing interaction between objects.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#8217;ve spent a couple of hours this week re-implementing &lt;a href=&quot;http://chimprawk.blogspot.com&quot;&gt;Fred Stutzmans&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;http://chimprawk.blogspot.com/2006/06/simple-microid-verifier.html&quot;&gt;Micro Id Verifier&lt;/a&gt; in ruby (I&amp;#8217;ll post it soon, just some database persistence to add).  The job of the validator is to connect to a given url and compare any &lt;a href=&quot;http://microid.org/&quot;&gt;micro_id&lt;/a&gt; found on that page with an expected micro_id supplied by the user.  All of my development has been off-line yet I needed a way to test that my objects were doing their job (i.e. connecting to the Internet).  It&amp;#8217;s actually irrelevant that I was off-line at the time, I&amp;#8217;d still need a repeatable way of ensuring my objects are doing their jobs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#8217;m using &lt;a href=&quot;http://ruby-doc.org/stdlib/libdoc/net/http/rdoc/index.html&quot;&gt;Net::&lt;span class=&quot;caps&quot;&gt;HTTP&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt; to look after grabbing the html for a given page and am certainly not worried about testing the workings of that library.  What I wanted to know, however, was that my client was utilising Net::&lt;span class=&quot;caps&quot;&gt;HTTP&lt;/span&gt; in the way expected.  I didn&amp;#8217;t have access to the mocking framework used at work so I fell back to a very lightweight method that we&amp;#8217;ve used previously.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The idea is to override the methods of an object that you expect to be called.  When the overridden method is called, we add the message to a log for later inspection.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The implementation I have at the moment comprises four methods, although we could quite easily do away with &amp;#8216;stub_instance_method&amp;#8217; (it just adds some safety checking to &amp;#8216;define_instance_method&amp;#8217;).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class=&quot;code ruby&quot;&gt;
class Object

  def metaclass
    class &amp;lt;&amp;lt; self; self; end
  end

  def define_instance_method(sym, &amp;amp;block)
    metaclass.__send__(:define_method, sym, &amp;amp;block)
  end

  def stub_instance_method(sym, &amp;amp;block)
    raise &quot;#{self} does not respond to &amp;lt;#{sym}&amp;gt; and therefore cannot be stubbed&quot; unless self.respond_to?(sym)
    define_instance_method(sym, &amp;amp;block)
  end

  def __log__
    @__log__ ||= []
  end

end
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A (partially adapted and potentially non-working) example of this code being used in my tests is as follows.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class=&quot;code ruby&quot;&gt;
def test_should_use_net_http_to_get_html_content
  url = &#39;http://localhost/page.htm&#39;
  net_http = Object.new
  net_http.define_instance_method(:get) { |path| __log__ &amp;lt;&amp;lt; &quot;get(#{path})&quot; }
  http_client = HttpClient.new
  http_client.get_html(url, net_http)

  assert_equal [&#39;get(/page.htm)&#39;], net_http.__log__
end
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I define a &amp;#8216;mock&amp;#8217; Net::&lt;span class=&quot;caps&quot;&gt;HTTP&lt;/span&gt; object (net_http) that records a message when it gets sent the &amp;#8216;get&amp;#8217; message.  I can then check the log to ensure that the expected method was called; and be (hopefully) safe in the knowledge that when I supply an actual Net::&lt;span class=&quot;caps&quot;&gt;HTTP&lt;/span&gt; object the code does what I expect.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

        <title>Generating a MicroId with Ruby</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;Very naive Ruby method to create a &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.microid.org&quot;&gt;MicroId&lt;/a&gt; for a given email and url.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class=&quot;code ruby&quot;&gt;
require &#39;digest/sha1&#39;

def micro_id(email, url)
  email_digest = Digest::SHA1.new(email).to_s
  url_digest = Digest::SHA1.new(url).to_s
  Digest::SHA1.new(email_digest + url_digest).to_s
end
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Note that there is no validation of the MicroId in this code at all.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

        <title>More helpful messages for Active Record validation errors in Rails testing</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;In testing (and production code) &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.reevoo.com&quot;&gt;we&lt;/a&gt; always try to persist &lt;a href=&quot;http://api.rubyonrails.com/classes/ActiveRecord/Base.html&quot;&gt;Active Record&lt;/a&gt; models with the bang variants (save! and create!).  This allows us to &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.martinfowler.com/ieeeSoftware/failFast.pdf&quot;&gt;fail fast&lt;/a&gt; if any of our models fail our  &lt;a href=&quot;http://api.rubyonrails.com/classes/ActiveRecord/Validations/ClassMethods.html&quot;&gt;validation&lt;/a&gt; rules.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The problem is that the standard &lt;a href=&quot;http://ruby-doc.org/stdlib/libdoc/test/unit/rdoc/index.html&quot;&gt;test/unit&lt;/a&gt; reporting framework displays the exception without any details of why the validation failed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class=&quot;code&quot;&gt;
 1) Error:‚Äã
test_should_fail_validation(AardvarkTest):‚Äã
ActiveRecord::RecordInvalid:‚ÄãActiveRecord::RecordInvalid
   /opt/local/lib/ruby/gems/1.8/gems/activerecord-1.13.2/lib/active_record/validations.rb:711:in &#39;save!&#39;
   /opt/local/lib/ruby/gems/1.8/gems/activerecord-1.13.2/lib/active_record/validations.rb:673:in &#39;create!&#39;
   /Users/chrisroos/dev/example_rails/test/unit/aardvark_test.rb:22:in &#39;test_should_fail_validation&#39;

1 tests, 0 assertions, 0 failures, 1 errors
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Note.&lt;/strong&gt; This isn&amp;#8217;t the fault of test/unit.  It has to deal with generic exceptions and so cannot &amp;#8216;know&amp;#8217; that Active Record Exceptions can be used to find the reason for the failure.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At this point, it would be very easy to jump into the code of the Active Record model, check out the validations and satisfy them within your code.  However, it&amp;#8217;d be much cooler if we could just add the reason for the failures to the error message that is displayed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I initially played around with a method that took a block and would wrap the block with a begin/rescue clause to explicitly catch RecordInvalid exceptions, displaying the reason for failure.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then I thought it&amp;#8217;d be cool if we could integrate slightly more with both test/unit and &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.rubyonrails.com&quot;&gt;rails&lt;/a&gt;.  The result is a &lt;a href=&quot;http://wiki.rubyonrails.org/rails/pages/Plugins&quot;&gt;plugin&lt;/a&gt; (&lt;a href=&quot;http://chrisroos.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/plugins/test_unit_active_record_errors/&quot;&gt;source&lt;/a&gt;) that can be installed as follows.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class=&quot;code shell&quot;&gt;
$ script/plugin install http://chrisroos.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/plugins/test_unit_active_record_errors/
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The output from a failed validation now includes the validation errors.  Yay.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class=&quot;code&quot;&gt;
 1) Error:‚Äã

1 tests, 0 assertions, 0 failures, 1 errors
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The code is pretty hacky and includes no tests.  It&amp;#8217;s only been tested on Mac Os X 10.4.6 with Ruby 1.8.2 and Rails 1.0.0 but please feel free to do what you will with it if you think it might be of some use to you.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

        <title>Improving search results</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;This will be obvious to most people, especially anyone that&amp;#8217;s taken the slightest bit of interest in their search engine rankings.  If text in the url matches the search query then that page is likely to get ranked higher than a page where the only the body matches the search query.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is an &lt;a href=&quot;http://blog.claimid.com/2006/05/tips-and-tricks-your-name-in-the-url/&quot;&gt;explanation&lt;/a&gt; from the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.claimid.com&quot;&gt;claimid&lt;/a&gt; folks or you can see it for yourself by &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.google.co.uk/search?hl=en&amp;amp;q=chris+roos&amp;amp;btnG=Google+Search&quot;&gt;googling for me&lt;/a&gt;.  My &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.odeo.com&quot;&gt;odeo&lt;/a&gt; profile appears third in the results (as of right now).  The url contains my name but apart from that it is essentially a blank page containing no info about me.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Anyhoo, the main point of this was to say that I emailed the claimid folks this morning to request they change my username from chrisjroos (my common moniker) to chrisroos.  I&amp;#8217;m not even exaggerating when I say that they&amp;#8217;d made the change and replied within ten minutes of my request.  That&amp;#8217;s fantastic service.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

        <title>Using active record models in rails migrations</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;I seem to remember that &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.reevoo.com&quot;&gt;we&lt;/a&gt; first came across the &amp;#8220;migrations out of sync with code&amp;#8221; problems around the time that Scott Laird &lt;a href=&quot;http://scottstuff.net/blog/articles/2005/10/31/migrating-in-two-dimensions&quot;&gt;posted&lt;/a&gt; about it regarding &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.typosphere.org&quot;&gt;typo&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Having just read &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.reevoo.com/blogs/bengriffiths&quot;&gt;Ben&amp;#8217;s&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.reevoo.com/blogs/bengriffiths/2006/05/10/misrepresenting-rails-reliability/&quot;&gt;post&lt;/a&gt; about rails reliability, I was reminded again about the pitfalls of using model code in migrations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;#8220;Migrations can be problematic if the code under which the migration was written changes before the migration is deployed and released.&amp;#8221;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We&amp;#8217;re a small team working on the same codebase, yet we still get bitten relatively frequently.  A while back we started to re-define our AR classes within our migrations to ensure that we weren&amp;#8217;t relying on model code.  This has been &lt;a href=&quot;http://rails.techno-weenie.net/tip/2006/2/23/safely_using_models_in_migrations&quot;&gt;documented&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;http://wrath.rubyonrails.org/pipermail/rails-core/2006-February/000830.html&quot;&gt;elsewhere&lt;/a&gt;.  The typo codebase has gone slightly further and created a &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.typosphere.org/trac/browser/trunk/lib/bare_migration.rb&quot;&gt;BareMigration module&lt;/a&gt; that takes care of some magic for you.  To be fair, I haven&amp;#8217;t looked in detail so am not entirely sure what it does..&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The problem with re-defining models in the migrations is that it relies on you remembering to re-define them (I&amp;#8217;m good at &amp;#8216;forgetting&amp;#8217; to do things unless I really have to).  There is nothing to stop you using the real models; that is, until someone complains that the migrations are broken and you have to fix it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We are currently using a slightly more robust (I think) solution that forces you to re-define any AR models that you wish to use in migrations.  It does this by hijacking the &amp;#8216;zero&amp;#8217; migration (a migration starting with 0 that gets loaded along with all other migrations but doesn&amp;#8217;t interfere in any other way) to ensure any AR derived classes are defined in a module.  It&amp;#8217;s naive but seems to work ok.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you don&amp;#8217;t already have a zero migration, then create one.  The name is important as you will need to create an empty class of the same name in the file itself (for migrations to be happy).  Ours is called 000_rails_ext.rb.  The code is below.  Our code isn&amp;#8217;t identical (yet) as I just realised that we had an ineffective call to super in the inherited method, now replaced with alias_method.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class=&quot;code ruby&quot;&gt;
class RailsExt
end

class ActiveRecord::Base
  class &amp;lt;&amp;lt; self
    alias_method :__original__inherited, :inherited
    def inherited(base)
      raise &quot;You&#39;re trying to use an ActiveRecord::Base derived class (--#{base}--) that is not defined in this migration.&quot; unless base.to_s =~ /^Migration.*/
      __original__inherited(base)
    end
  end
end

Dispatcher.reset_application!
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The inherited callback is triggered everytime we define a class that inherits from ActiveRecord::Base.  All we do is check that its name starts with Migration and raise an error if not (failing fast is good).  The name is the fully qualified name and so includes namespaces.  This is good as it allows us to place all re-defined classes in a module named Migration&amp;lt;number&amp;gt;.  This module can then be included in the migration class itself.  Although I can&amp;#8217;t remember exactly now, I think the reason we need to reset_application! is because we have some calls to our models in environment.rb.  These models would already be loaded and therefore any future references to them (in the migrations) would bypass our custom inherited method.  By resetting the app, we are sure that we have no AR models loaded.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To re-define the models in the migration, we use something like..&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class=&quot;code ruby&quot;&gt;
class MyFirstMigration &amp;lt; ActiveRecord::Migration
  def self.up
  end
  def self.down
  end
end

module Migration001
  class Person &amp;lt; ActiveRecord::Base
  end
end
MyFirstMigration.send(:include, Migration001)
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Although sending the migration class the include message with the module isn&amp;#8217;t great, we use it as it allows us to re-define all our classes below the actual migration.  If we were to place the module at the top then this wouldn&amp;#8217;t be required but I feel that it gets in the way of being able to read the migration clearly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;A problem with this method and re-defining classes directly in the migration&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Both methods create AR derived classes in a namespace that isn&amp;#8217;t the root namespace.  We came across a problem where we were serializing the contents of one of these re-defined classes to the database from within our migration.  When we came to read the serialized data in our code, it didn&amp;#8217;t &amp;#8216;know&amp;#8217; what a Migration001::Person was and so raised an exception.  Without thinking about it too much, I think this might cause problems with &lt;span class=&quot;caps&quot;&gt;STI&lt;/span&gt; too (I&amp;#8217;ve seen notes to this effect from the Typo migration solution).&lt;/p&gt;</description>

        <title>Storing passwords online</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;I regularly access the Internet from three different locations.  Quite often, I will log into my bank account or other sites that have complicated login procedures (i.e. require more than just username and password) from each of these sites.  I&amp;#8217;m not good at remembering this stuff so used to have it stored in some software called &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.iliumsoft.com/site/ew/ewallet.html&quot;&gt;eWallet&lt;/a&gt; on the Pc.  This was fine when I was on one computer most of the time but as soon as I started using multiple computers, including a Mac, it became problematic.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To get around the multiple computer problem, I ditched eWallet and now store all my info online, in a self-hosted slightly customised version of &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.instiki.org&quot;&gt;instiki&lt;/a&gt;.  To achieve this in what I hope is some kind of secure way, I encrypt each set of data using &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.gnupg.org&quot;&gt;gpg&lt;/a&gt;.  I then store this data in its own wiki page.  The wiki itself has very basic password protection and is not hosted over ssl but I&amp;#8217;m thinking that because the decryption takes place on the client I should be ok.  Granted, it means that my secret key is on three computers and could therefore be compromised but I hope this is unlikely&amp;#8230;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The (hopefully) constant availability of my data outweighs the slight pain caused by having to decrypt the data each time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#8217;m genuinely not sure if this is a great idea or not regards security so maybe someone cleverer than I could advise if you come across this&amp;#8230;&lt;/p&gt;</description>

&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&#39;description&#39;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I bought this recently to wile away the large amount of time I spend on trains.  I bought it just after Apple released the 1gb nano and therefore benefitted from the price drop to ¬£69.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Overall, it&amp;#8217;s pretty good.  Although not the largest mp3 device on the market, there&amp;#8217;s more than enough storage for my current needs.  I like the ability to resume playing from the last stopped position.  This is useful for spoken word audio as it would be difficult to get back to the exact same position without a display showing how far through you are.  One thing I didn&amp;#8217;t know for certain until purchasing the unit was that there are two modes, shuffle and ordered play.  Again, the ordered play can come in useful for spoken word (podcast) content.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Although I&amp;#8217;m generally quite pleased I do have a few niggles with it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;The itunes software doesn&amp;#8217;t allow you to copy tracks from multiple pc&amp;#8217;s (apparently all other ipod&amp;#8217;s allow this).  If you have copied tracks from one pc and wish to then copy from another you first have to remove all tracks on the ipod.  You can actually copy the tracks directly from the ipod filesystem and play them on a different pc but I&amp;#8217;m guessing that if they&amp;#8217;ve been purchased through itunes and therefore drm&amp;#8217;d up this might not work (I only tried it with downloaded podcasts).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;The cord used to place the shuffle round your neck is too short.  It hangs at about chest high making it difficult to get access to the shuffle if under clothing (which I&amp;#8217;m guessing is pretty likely).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;I have a feeling it caused problems with my work mac (unconfirmed) when it was charging in the keyboard usb port.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;As someone that gets annoyed by hearing other peoples music, I try to ensure that I have the volume at a level that can&amp;#8217;t be heard outside of my headphones.  This isn&amp;#8217;t always easy with the supplied set (although I&amp;#8217;d suggest this is more a problem of in-ear headphones rather than the apple specific ones).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

        <title>Rails table pluralization</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;I was talking to someone recently about the pluralisation of table names in &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.rubyonrails.org&quot;&gt;rails&lt;/a&gt;.  It was grating him because some hand built queries no longer read very naturally.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class=&quot;code sql&quot;&gt;
-- (in rails) requesting the forename of the &#39;first&#39; person
SELECT forename FROM people WHERE people.id = 1;

-- would read better as
SELECT forename FROM person WHERE person.id = 1;
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://po-ru.com/&quot;&gt;Paul&lt;/a&gt; (a colleague at &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.reevoo.com&quot;&gt;reevoo&lt;/a&gt;) pointed out that there are two sides to the singular/plural table name debate.  You will always have some queries (as above) that will work better when the table is singular; and others (as below) that will work better when the table is plural.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class=&quot;code sql&quot;&gt;
-- requesting all people having a country of &#39;uk&#39;
SELECT * FROM person WHERE country = &#39;UK&#39;;

-- (in rails) would read better as
SELECT * FROM people WHERE country = &#39;UK&#39;;
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Personally, because of the very small amount of hand written sql I&amp;#8217;ve had to use with Rails this has never been an issue to me.  However, it did make me think about a slight adaptation to Active Record&amp;#8230;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By default (in Rails), you create a singular (active record) model (person) that maps to the plural table (people).  Although very convenient (it&amp;#8217;s the reason I&amp;#8217;ve rarely had to touch sql), it too suffers from the same problems outlined in the queries above.  I think the two statements below show the same sort of natural vs unnatural language that appears in the sql above.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class=&quot;code ruby&quot;&gt;
# good english (acting on a single person)
Person.name = &#39;chris&#39;
Person.save

# bad english (we are asking for multiple people)
Person.find(:all, :conditions =&amp;gt; &quot;country = &#39;uk&#39;&quot;)
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The adaptation to active record I was thinking about would allow you to operate on both a Person and People, using the variant that made the code read more naturally.  That is, we could leave the Person.name example above as is, but change the Person.find to People.find&lt;sup class=&quot;footnote&quot; id=&quot;fnr1&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn1&quot;&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;.  There are different ways to go about this but to get some of the way there with a little code (i.e. not having to manually create both singular and plural classes for each table); I came up with the following simple hack.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class=&quot;code ruby&quot;&gt;
class ActiveRecord::Base
  class &amp;lt;&amp;lt; self
    alias_method :__existing_inherited, :inherited
    def inherited(child)
      __existing_inherited(child)
      plural_class = child.to_s.pluralize
      unless plural_class =~ /#&amp;lt;Class:./ or Object.constants.include?(plural_class)
        Object.const_set(plural_class, Class.new(child))
      end
    end
  end
end
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Just add it to the bottom of your environment.rb file and when you first reference one of your singular classes it will automatically descend a plural class from it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are lots of things wrong with this code and many better ways for it to be implemented but it was really just for me to see if I could do it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;footnote&quot; id=&quot;fn1&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fnr1&quot;&gt;&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/a&gt; Boring and sad.  I was going to start that sentence with i.e. but wasn&amp;#8217;t sure whether that was grammatically correct (I&amp;#8217;m not very good at English).  I did a quick search and found that it translates as &amp;#8216;that is&amp;#8217; from the Latin which is much better.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

        <title>Installing Collaboa</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;I just spent a few minutes installing &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.collaboa.org&quot;&gt;collaboa&lt;/a&gt; on my &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.freebsd.org&quot;&gt;FreeBsd&lt;/a&gt; server.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I already had a number of the pre-requisites installed.  All that was outstanding was &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.swig.org&quot;&gt;swig&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.freshports.org/devel/subversion-ruby/&quot;&gt;subversion-ruby bindings&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.freshports.org/converters/ruby-iconv/&quot;&gt;ruby iconv bindings&lt;/a&gt; which were all installed using packages.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Collaboa is a &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.rubyonrails.org&quot;&gt;rails&lt;/a&gt; alternative to &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.edgewall.com/trac/&quot;&gt;trac&lt;/a&gt;, minus the wiki.  It basically provides a nice frontend to subversion and some project management&amp;#8217;y type stuff.  I&amp;#8217;m using it to host my &lt;a href=&quot;http://dev.seagul.co.uk&quot;&gt;poor attempts&lt;/a&gt; at coding.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

        <title>ClaimId for managing online identity</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;I started reading about &lt;a href=&quot;http://claimid.com&quot;&gt;claim id&lt;/a&gt; about a week ago, just as they were talking about launching a public beta.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As soon as the beta was launched I signed up and added &lt;a href=&quot;http://claimid.com/chrisjroos&quot;&gt;some links&lt;/a&gt; to content about/by me on the web.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I like the approach they take; very simply grouping links based on their meaning to you.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One of the things we want for &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.reevoo.com&quot;&gt;reevoo&lt;/a&gt; is the concept of &amp;#8216;my reviews&amp;#8217;.  My personal preference has been to utilise one of many &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.sixapart.com/typekey/index&quot;&gt;existing&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;http://openid.net/&quot;&gt;authentication&lt;/a&gt; services; but something has changed in my mind since seeing claimid: sadly I can&amp;#8217;t quite put my finger on it at present.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

        <title>Ruby Quiz number 67 (metakoans)</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;I just finished my first &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.rubyquiz.com&quot;&gt;rubyquiz&lt;/a&gt;.  Yay.  I take a look every now and then but never seem to find the time to spend on them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I made the time for &lt;a href=&quot;http://rubyquiz.com/quiz67.html&quot;&gt;metakoans&lt;/a&gt; as it involved &amp;#8216;meta-programming&amp;#8217; which I&amp;#8217;ve recently spent some time on at &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.reevoo.com&quot;&gt;work&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My solution is here, and although it passes all the tests of the quiz it&amp;#8217;s probably not great as this stuff still confuses me somewhat.  I didn&amp;#8217;t take a look at any other solutions (although I will shortly) so any similarity is coincidental.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class=&quot;code ruby&quot;&gt;
class Object

  def attribute(arg, &amp;amp;block)

    if arg.class == Hash
      attribute = arg.keys[0]
      value = arg.values[0]
    else
      attribute = arg
      value = block ? block : nil
    end

    class_eval do

      attr_writer attribute

      define_method(attribute) do
        unless instance_variable_get(&quot;@#{attribute}&quot;)
          default_value = (value.class == Proc) ? instance_eval(&amp;amp;value) : value
          instance_variable_set(&quot;@#{attribute}&quot;, default_value)
        end
        instance_variable_get(&quot;@#{attribute}&quot;)
      end

      define_method(&quot;#{attribute}?&quot;) do
        instance_variable_get(&quot;@#{attribute}&quot;) ? true : false
      end

    end

  end

end
&lt;/pre&gt;</description>

        <title>Some Freebsd housekeeping</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;I use &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.exonetric.com/&quot;&gt;exonetric&lt;/a&gt; to host this &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.typosphere.org&quot;&gt;typo&lt;/a&gt; instance.  It&amp;#8217;s on a &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.freebsd.org&quot;&gt;freebsd&lt;/a&gt; virtual server so I have to maintain everything.  For a long time, I&amp;#8217;ve been using &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.mysql.org&quot;&gt;mysql&lt;/a&gt; 4.  This is fine apart from a problem during initial installation causing it not to start automatically on machine restart.  This meant that whenever the virtual machine was rebooted I had to manually restart mysql, which basically wouldn&amp;#8217;t happen until I actually noticed it &amp;#8211; not cool.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I spent the time today to upgrade to mysql 5.  Luckily this solved the auto start problem and mysql now comes up with the machine.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Although incredibly interesting (hmm) that wasn&amp;#8217;t really the point of the post.  This is&amp;#8230;  Since using freebsd I&amp;#8217;ve always relied on &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.freebsd.org/ports/&quot;&gt;ports&lt;/a&gt; (instructions for compilation of software) for the installation of software.  When installing mysql today, I used the pre-compiled package binary instead.  I&amp;#8217;m amazed at how much faster it is; and now really can&amp;#8217;t believe I&amp;#8217;ve been bothering with the ports all this time.  I guess it was some kind of anal retentive control I thought I was getting by compiling the software myself; when infact I was only ever compiling with the default options and just wasting time&amp;#8230;  Ho hum.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Two moral&amp;#8217;s here me thinks.  Use packages if you don&amp;#8217;t know what you&amp;#8217;re doing (I don&amp;#8217;t).  Don&amp;#8217;t mess around with things you don&amp;#8217;t understand (manually deleting ports dir before un-installing ports and then expecting packages to just overwrite them.  Oh well, it seems ok).&lt;/p&gt;</description>

        <title>Rails rake testing without database</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;Continuing from the &lt;a href=&quot;/blog/2006-02-23-rails-testing-without-database&quot;&gt;previous post&lt;/a&gt;, it appears that the rake testing tasks are also tightly coupled to active record.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This feels quite dirty, but I&amp;#8217;ve managed to get round it by manipulating the tasks from the outside (they are buried in the rails libs).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To replicate, create a new file called &amp;#8216;default.rake&amp;#8217; in the lib/tasks/ directory within your rails project, and paste in the following code.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class=&quot;code ruby&quot;&gt;
Rake::Task::TASKS.delete(&#39;default&#39;)
Rake::Task[:test_units].instance_variable_set(:@prerequisites, [])
Rake::Task[:test_functional].instance_variable_set(:@prerequisites, [])

task :default do
  Rake::Task[:test_units].invoke      rescue got_error = true
  Rake::Task[:test_functional].invoke rescue got_error = true
  raise &quot;Test failures&quot; if got_error
end
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Because this relies on the internal implementation of rake (instance variable names and &lt;span class=&quot;caps&quot;&gt;TASKS&lt;/span&gt; constant) it might well do very bad things to versions that aren&amp;#8217;t 0.6.2.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Update 17:20&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Just realised that I don&amp;#8217;t need most of the code above.  All you actually need in default.rake is as follows.  Stoopid Chris.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class=&quot;code ruby&quot;&gt;
Rake::Task[:test_units].instance_variable_set(:@prerequisites, [])
Rake::Task[:test_functional].instance_variable_set(:@prerequisites, [])
&lt;/pre&gt;</description>

        <title>Rails testing without database</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;Just yesterday I wanted to create a very quick rails app that didn&amp;#8217;t rely on a database.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I removed :active_record from the frameworks loaded in evironment, but apparently this wasn&amp;#8217;t quite enough.  The setup and teardown methods in Test::Unit::TestCase were still attempting to load fixtures (which implies that active record is still present somewhere), which require the presence of a database.  This was causing tests not to run.  Having had a quick look at how active record intercepts the setup and teardown methods, it was relatively simple to stop it from doing so.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Just add the code below within the Test::Unit::TestCase declaration in test_helper.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class=&quot;code ruby&quot;&gt;
def self.dont_use_fixtures
  class_eval do
    def self.method_added(method); end
    def setup; end
    def teardown; end
  end
end
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This still requires that you add dont_use_fixtures into each test class definition.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class=&quot;code ruby&quot;&gt;
class MyTest &amp;lt; Test::Unit::TestCase
  dont_use_fixtures
  def test_
    # my first test
  end
end
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Having just written this it&amp;#8217;s obvious now that it would make more sense to not require the declaration in each test class (as we supposedly don&amp;#8217;t even have access to active record).  We should probably also play fair and pass messages back to our parent if method_added isn&amp;#8217;t being called with either setup or teardown.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The new code becomes (again, in Test::Unit::TestCase definition in test_helper).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class=&quot;code ruby&quot;&gt;
def self.method_added(method)
  super unless [:setup, :teardown].include?(method.to_sym)
end
def setup; end
def teardown; end
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This appears to work ok&amp;#8230;&lt;/p&gt;</description>

        <title>Alternative to Putty Ssh on Windows</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#8217;ve used &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.chiark.greenend.org.uk/~sgtatham/putty/&quot;&gt;putty&lt;/a&gt; for all my ssh needs on windows for a long time now.  It&amp;#8217;s great but certainly lacks a little polish in some areas.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The one feature I really wanted was tabbed sessions.  After a little searching I came across a comment on this &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.jroller.com/page/thuss?entry=tabbed_terminals_for_windows_redux&quot;&gt;post&lt;/a&gt; that mentioned an open source alternative called &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.poderosa.org/&quot;&gt;poderosa&lt;/a&gt;.  I just got round to downloading and I must say that so far it looks great.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The only potential downside is that it relies on the .net framework (which I&amp;#8217;d so far managed without) so it&amp;#8217;s not quite as light weight as putty but good none-the-less.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

        <title>Reviews Reevoos Reviews</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;We&amp;#8217;ve just recently started poking our head above the radar at &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.reevoo.com&quot;&gt;work&lt;/a&gt; regarding our &amp;#8216;new&amp;#8217; (been around for a while but just undergone a re-design) review site &amp;#8211; &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.reevoo.com&quot;&gt;Reevoo&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Take a look, why not.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The main point of interest (for me) is that we are now aggregating reviews from blog entries.  I&amp;#8217;ve been commuting a lot recently and have had plenty of time to read (check my &lt;a href=&quot;http://allconsuming.net/person/chrisjroos&quot;&gt;recent consumption&lt;/a&gt;).  I&amp;#8217;m more than happy to write reviews of these books but I really cannot be bothered to go over the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.amazon.co.uk&quot;&gt;Amazon&lt;/a&gt;, or anywhere else for that matter, to do so.  Now I don&amp;#8217;t have to; I can write the review right here and have it appear on any site that I can &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.reevoo.com/web_services/manual_ping&quot;&gt;notify&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Cool huh.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

        <title>In memory sqlite database for rails testing</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Update 12th June 2006&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is now a &lt;a href=&quot;http://nubyonrails.com/articles/2006/06/01/san-francisco-sqlite3-memory-tests-asteroids&quot;&gt;plugin&lt;/a&gt; from &lt;a href=&quot;http://nubyonrails.com/&quot;&gt;Geoffrey Grosenbach&lt;/a&gt; that encapsulates this hack.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I finally took some time to get the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.sqlite.org&quot;&gt;sqlite&lt;/a&gt; in memory database working correctly for testing &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.rubyonrails.com&quot;&gt;Rails&lt;/a&gt; apps.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It appears to be available by default (appearing in the example database.yml file) as&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class=&quot;code yaml&quot;&gt;
sqlite3_in_memory_example:
  adapter: sqlite3
  database: &quot;:memory:&quot;
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Unfortunately, it doesn&amp;#8217;t appear to be quite as easy as just replacing sqlite3_in_memory_example with test&amp;#8230;  The main problem being that in-memory databases have a tendency not to hang around (odd that).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My solution (which has every chance of being bad or downright incorrect) is to force the creation of the database in memory at the beginning of the tests.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The current implementation relies on either schema.rb being present or comprehensive migrations (i.e. you can use migrations to get a database from zero to your current development status).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you wish to use the schema.rb approach then uncomment the following line in your environment.rb file.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class=&quot;code ruby&quot;&gt;
config.active_record.schema_format = :ruby
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Un-commenting this option ensures that the database schema is exported to schema.rb rather than adapter specific sql (ENV_database.sql).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Add the following code right below the &amp;#8220;# Include your application configuration below&amp;#8221; line in environment.rb.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class=&quot;code ruby&quot;&gt;
def in_memory_database?
  ENV[&quot;RAILS_ENV&quot;] == &quot;test&quot; and
  ActiveRecord::Base.connection.class == ActiveRecord::ConnectionAdapters::SQLiteAdapter and
  Rails::Configuration.new.database_configuration[&#39;test&#39;][&#39;database&#39;] == &#39;:memory:&#39;
end

if in_memory_database?
  puts &quot;creating sqlite in memory database&quot;
  load &quot;#{RAILS_ROOT}/db/schema.rb&quot; # use db agnostic schema by default
  # ActiveRecord::Migrator.up(&#39;db/migrate&#39;) # use migrations
end
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The reason for adding this code at this point and not just at the end of the environment file is that you may have further logic in environment that actually relies on the database being present.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you are running your tests using rake then it shouldn&amp;#8217;t matter whether you use the schema or migrations to create the database.  This is because the rake test tasks rely on the test database being set-up, which involves exporting the development db schema to file.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you wish to run tests individually (which, of course, you do) and you choose to use the schema to create your test scructure, you must make sure that it first exists.  The easiest way is to run the following rake task.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class=&quot;code shell&quot;&gt;
$ rake db_schema_dump
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That should be all there is to it; although I must confess that I&amp;#8217;ve seen additional strange problems when running certain tests against the sqlite in-memory database.  In certain cases I think these may be fixture related.  Where, in &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.mysql.org&quot;&gt;MySql&lt;/a&gt;, you seem to be able to omit required fields (not null) from a fixtures file, sqlite requires their presence.  In other cases; who knows&amp;#8230;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Testing your sqlite installation&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One final note that may be of interest.  When I first started playing with sqlite3 with Ruby it seems that I didn&amp;#8217;t have it installed correctly (relying on pre-installed sqlite and the sqlite3-ruby gem).  As per &lt;a href=&quot;http://wiki.rubyonrails.org/rails/pages/HowtoUseSQLite&quot;&gt;this article&lt;/a&gt; I had to un-install sqlite3-ruby gem and first install the swig port before re-installing sqlite3-ruby gem.  You can test for the correct installation by running the &lt;a href=&quot;http://wiki.rubyonrails.com/rails/pages/ActiveRecord&quot;&gt;Active Record&lt;/a&gt; tests against sqlite by following these steps.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Change directory to Active Record tests (rails/activerecord/test)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Run base_test.rb, supplying the location of the sqlite3 connection to the load path.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;ruby -I &quot;connections/native_sqlite3/&quot; base_test.rb&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You can also run the tests using the sqlite3 in memory connection.  To do so, perform these actions before running the tests as above.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Remove the standard sqlite3 connection&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;rm connections/native_sqlite3/connection.rb&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Rename in_memory_connection.rb as connection.rb&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;mv connections/in_memory_connection.rb connections/connection.rb&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#8217;d suggest doing this against an svn checked out copy of rails, purely due to the these at which the changes can be reverted.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Useless stats&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Changing to in-memory testing shaved about 33% off the running time of our unit tests.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

        <title>Idea - Typo sidebar for allconsuming</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;There currently doesn&amp;#8217;t seem to be a &lt;a href=&quot;http://typo.leetsoft.com&quot;&gt;typo&lt;/a&gt; sidebar for &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.allsonsuming.net&quot;&gt;allconsuming&lt;/a&gt; &amp;#8211; I kinda think there should be.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Having said that, maybe it&amp;#8217;s not required as allconsuming already provide javascript to insert the contents into your blog.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We&amp;#8217;ll see.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

        <title>(One of the reasons) Why I really really don't like uk2</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;I had the mis-fortune to sign-up with uk2.net (intentionally not linked &amp;#8211; how petty) quite some time ago, registering domains at first and subsequently using their free email service.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Although there are lots of things wrong with them; the one that has annoyed me for a while, and has done so again this morning; is their lack of &amp;#8216;remind me of my password&amp;#8217;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It would appear that one of my old email addresses is still active on their server &amp;#8211; and is still happily forwarding all mail to my primary email account.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Luckily, the only mail to come through this account is spam.  Great.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As this account is so very very old I have absolutely no recollection of the password used.  I&amp;#8217;ve tried to re-set it or remove the account in the past; to no avail.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I just tried again this morning &amp;#8211; still no luck.  Apparently I can &lt;a href=&quot;http://mailme.uk2net.com/max_password.html&quot;&gt;buy the privilege&lt;/a&gt; of a password reset/reminder by sending the princely sum of ¬£10.  Just like all the other email services on the web&amp;#8230;  Yeah.  Right.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

        <title>douban as alternative to allconsuming?</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;Looks to me like &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.douban.net&quot;&gt;douban&lt;/a&gt; is very similar to &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.allconsuming.net&quot;&gt;all consuming&lt;/a&gt;.  I think the difference may be the ability to add more structured rating to the content in douban.  Not sure though.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

        <description>&lt;p&gt;&amp;#8230; and aggregate the data.  Compare average daily spend between people.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Doesn&amp;#8217;t ask for any personal data, including what it was spent on, just how much.  May or (most likely) may not be useful in a social kinda way.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Probably not.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

        <title>Print to Pdf in Windows without Acrobat Writer</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;(Probably) the standard way to print to &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PDF&quot;&gt;Pdf&lt;/a&gt; in Windows is to buy &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.adobe.com/products/acrobat/main.html&quot;&gt;Adobe Acrobat&lt;/a&gt; or use one of the alternatives (which come with various different licences and are of varying quality; from experience over the last couple of years).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is, however, a completely free alternative, providing you don&amp;#8217;t mind going through a couple of steps to implement it (which I don&amp;#8217;t).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The basic premise is that you print to &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PostScript&quot;&gt;PostScript&lt;/a&gt; using a PostScript compatible printer driver and then use &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.cs.wisc.edu/~ghost/&quot;&gt;Ghostscript&lt;/a&gt; to convert from PostScript to Pdf.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These instructions work in Windows XP but should be very similar in all versions of Windows.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Install PostScript compatible printer.&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Add a Printer.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Choose &amp;#8216;Local printer&amp;#8217; and do not &amp;#8216;automatically detect&amp;#8217;.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Select &amp;#8216;&lt;span class=&quot;caps&quot;&gt;FILE&lt;/span&gt;: (Print to File)&amp;#8217; in the list next to &amp;#8216;Use the following port&amp;#8217;.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Choose a PS printer.  I&amp;#8217;m currently using HP Color LaserJet PS.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Select whether you want to use this as your default printer and choose no to printing a test page.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Download and install &lt;span class=&quot;caps&quot;&gt;AFPL&lt;/span&gt; Ghostscript&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Visit the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.cs.wisc.edu/~ghost/&quot;&gt;Ghostscript site&lt;/a&gt; and follow the &amp;#8216;Obtaining &lt;span class=&quot;caps&quot;&gt;AFPL&lt;/span&gt; Ghostscript &amp;lt;version&amp;gt;&amp;#8217; link.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Download the version for Windows, which at the time of writing is called  gs853w32.exe.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Double click the downloaded file to install.  Use the defaults during installation.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Download and install GSview&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Visit the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.cs.wisc.edu/~ghost/gsview/index.htm&quot;&gt;GSview site&lt;/a&gt; and follow the &amp;#8216;Obtaining GSview 4.7 link&amp;#8217;.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Download the version for Windows, which at the time of writing is called  gsv47w32.exe.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Double click the downloaded file to install.  Use the defaults during installation.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Print something&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Open a file and choose to print to your PostScript printer.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;On clicking the Print button, you will be prompted to specify a filename to save the PostScript document to.  Supply the full path to the file here, for example &amp;#8216;c:\page.ps&amp;#8217;.  Although the .ps extension is optional it makes it easier to open directly in GSview if this is supplied.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Convert the PostScript file to Pdf&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Double click on the &amp;#8216;c:\page.ps&amp;#8217; file to open it in GSview.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Click OK to close the software registration prompt and you will see the PostScript interpretation of your file on the screen.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Click File &amp;gt; Convert and choose &amp;#8216;pdfwrite&amp;#8217; as the device, a suitable resolution (default of 600 should be fine) and click OK.  You will be prompted to save the converted Pdf file somewhere&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Enter the filename to save the file with, noting that .pdf doesn&amp;#8217;t get added automatically, e.g. specify page.pdf.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Open the new .pdf file in either &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.adobe.com/products/acrobat/readstep2.html&quot;&gt;Adobe Reader&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=&quot;/blog/2005-11-13-windows-adobe-acrobat-reader-alternative&quot;&gt;an alternative&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

        <title>Patching the rails</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;Yay.  I made my &lt;a href=&quot;http://dev.rubyonrails.org/ticket/3189&quot;&gt;first patch&lt;/a&gt; for &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.rubyonrails.com&quot;&gt;Rails&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#8217;m just waiting for a response along the lines of &amp;#8216;thats by design crazy fool&amp;#8217;, or similar&amp;#8230;&lt;/p&gt;</description>

        <title>voo2do vs tadalist</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;I was taking a look at the &lt;a href=&quot;http://web2.wsj2.com/the_best_web_20_software_of_2005.htm&quot;&gt;best web 2.0 software&lt;/a&gt; when I came across a to do list alternative to &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.tadalist.com&quot;&gt;tada&lt;/a&gt; called &lt;a href=&quot;http://voo2do.com/&quot;&gt;voo2do&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I just signed up to take a look, but unfortunately wasn&amp;#8217;t amazingly impressed.  Fortunately it is easy to &lt;a href=&quot;/blog/2005-11-26-it-should-be-easy-to-cancel-online-accounts&quot;&gt;cancel your account&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is obviously subjective but the interface to voo2do isn&amp;#8217;t amazing, although there is some great use of Ajax to let you tab between input fields when entering tasks.  I also found it too complicated for my simple mind.  I guess I think a to do list should literally be a list of one line items that need to be done at some/any point in time (which is exactly what tada offers, nothing more and nothing less).  I think that once you need something more than that, it probably doesn&amp;#8217;t live on a todo list but in something slightly more structured.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I certainly think there are improvements that could be made to tada (some of which can be overcome with the use of &lt;a href=&quot;http://greasemonkey.mozdev.org/&quot;&gt;greasemonkey&lt;/a&gt; and this &lt;a href=&quot;http://userscripts.org/scripts/show/754&quot;&gt;tada user script&lt;/a&gt;) but for now it&amp;#8217;s going to be what I stick with.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

        <title>Backpack sms reminders to orange uk</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#8217;ve been using the reminders feature of &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.backpackit.com&quot;&gt;backpack&lt;/a&gt; to text me when I need to be doing something time specific.  As per &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.backpackit.com/forum/viewtopic.php?id=16&quot;&gt;this&lt;/a&gt; thread in the forum, although I get the text messages, there is no subject; meaning I have to remember what it was that I wanted to be reminded about.  Hmmm.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Following the advice from that thread, I just set-up a forwarding rule on my &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.fastmail.fm&quot;&gt;email providers&lt;/a&gt; server to forward reminder alerts from backpack to my orange account.  This is in place of getting backpack to send directly to my orange email.  I now get the subjects in my text messages as expected.  Yay.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

        <title>Maximum password length is bad</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;As &lt;a href=&quot;/blog/2005-11-18-pwdhash&quot;&gt;mentioned previously&lt;/a&gt; I&amp;#8217;ve started migrating my online accounts to use &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.pwdhash.com&quot;&gt;pwdhash&lt;/a&gt;  Yesterday was the turn of &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.ticketmaster.co.uk&quot;&gt;ticketmaster&lt;/a&gt;.  Well, it turns out their maximum password length is 12 characters.  My key (let alone hashed password) is greater than 12 characters so I&amp;#8217;ve had to leave it as it was, negating the security and convenience of using pwdhash.  There is absolutely no reason ever (at least not that I can think of ;-)) to impose this limit on a password.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bad ticketmaster.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

        <title>Operating systems should be managed by version control</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;I spent from about 09:30 until 15:00 yesterday trying to get some graphics software talking to two output devices (basically printers) on Windows.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On arrival, it kinda worked, although not as requested.  There were some additional problems that needed to be sorted too.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I managed to go from a working state to a non-working state very quickly (great) and then had to spend several hours trying to return it.  In the end, I had one of the connected machines talking correctly but couldn&amp;#8217;t for the life of me work out the other one.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I found myself trying to diagnose the problem (complaints of missing driver files / mis-communication between ports) using several (very good) utilities from &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.sysinternals.com&quot;&gt;sys internals&lt;/a&gt;.  Indeed these did help to a certain extent but it was not easy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Coming from a development perspective where every little change is registered in version control, it got me to thinking.  If the changes to an operating system were version controlled I&amp;#8217;d be able to see exactly what changed during every &amp;#8216;upgrade&amp;#8217; to the OS, making it potentially easier to spot the cause of a problem and far easier to roll back to a working state.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I know that Windows XP (which this machine was running) offers a kind of &amp;#8216;rollback&amp;#8217; functionality; but, to be honest, I don&amp;#8217;t trust it in the slightest; hence not using it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mmm, I think I might install a fresh copy of XP, add all files to version control (which I guess might not even work), change something and then diff between the versions.  I can already think of problems when diffing registry files as they are in binary format so it will not be easy to see differences.. Although, I guess it wouldn&amp;#8217;t be too difficult to store registry files in a text format, i.e. customize the version control somehow.  Just an idea.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

        <title>Transparency in business</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;This started out as a few paragraphs at the end of the &lt;a href=&quot;/blog/2005-11-26-it-should-be-easy-to-cancel-online-accounts&quot;&gt;previous post&lt;/a&gt; but I thought it better suited on it&amp;#8217;s own.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In my current thinking, I basically equate transparency with confidence.  Traditionally, people don&amp;#8217;t tell you how much things cost (a sweeping statement I know).  They may have example prices that can be negotiated on, advertised prices with small print (that alters the same) or just try very hard to hide the pricing altogether&lt;sup class=&quot;footnote&quot; id=&quot;fnr1&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn1&quot;&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;.  I believe that if you&amp;#8217;re confident in your product/service you will have no reason to obfuscate the price (in these and other ways).  If you don&amp;#8217;t have to disguise your price then you are able to place it very prominently on your site.  It turns out to be the same folks prominently &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.strongspace.com/plans&quot;&gt;displaying&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.basecamphq.com/signup&quot;&gt;their&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.dropsend.com/pricingsignup.php&quot;&gt;pricing&lt;/a&gt; also making it very easy to cancel your account (see now how it links to the previous post?).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#8217;m thinking that you have to be pretty confident to offer this level of transparency in your product/service; hence my initial statement.  As a slight aside/addition, most of the services that are following this style (is it coincidence they seem to be web 2.0/agile folks?) also offer free versions of their services which again indicates their confidence.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Transparency as a buzzword seems to increasing in popularity with the folks at &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.riffs.com&quot;&gt;riffs&lt;/a&gt; even using it to describe their &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.riffs.com/doc.cgi?section=privacy&quot;&gt;privacy policy&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#8217;m sure there&amp;#8217;s probably meaning somewhere in this disjointed ramble but having just re-read it I&amp;#8217;m not so sure.  Maybe I&amp;#8217;ll revisit it at some point, but then again, maybe I wont; we&amp;#8217;ll see.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;footnote&quot; id=&quot;fn1&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fnr1&quot;&gt;&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/a&gt; This was particularly annoying just recently when I was looking for a new broadband provider.  Of all the websites I visited, I don&amp;#8217;t recall being able to find conclusive pricing on any of them.  Some would quote a monthly price but actually expect a year up front while other&amp;#8217;s might quote a genuine monthly cost but then make it very difficult to find minimum contract terms, and even more difficult to find the cost of breaking those terms.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

        <title>It should be easy to cancel online accounts</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;It bugs me when I&amp;#8217;m unable to cancel accounts I have for various online services.  I guess that I&amp;#8217;ve possibly become annoyed by it because lots of the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.backpackit.com&quot;&gt;more&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.basecamphq.com&quot;&gt;recent&lt;/a&gt; (&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.blinksale.com&quot;&gt;cool&lt;/a&gt;) &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.strongspace.com&quot;&gt;offerings&lt;/a&gt; make it very easy to cancel.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I was initially aiming this rant at &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.yahoo.com&quot;&gt;yahoo&lt;/a&gt; as I&amp;#8217;ve had a user there for about seven years (hmm, that seems too long but I&amp;#8217;m pretty certain it&amp;#8217;s correct) and didn&amp;#8217;t think I could cancel it.  It would actually appear that I can cancel it but they still make it relatively difficult to do (go to help, click on article, follow link and then cancel).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Actually, I just changed the title of the post from &lt;strong&gt;I should be able to close online accounts&lt;/strong&gt; to it&amp;#8217;s present form due to the yahoo finding (although I&amp;#8217;m pretty certain there are lots of other services that don&amp;#8217;t allow for cancelling).&lt;/p&gt;</description>

        <title>Firefox close tabs like Safari</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;Having got really used to the location of the close button in &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.apple.com/uk/macosx/features/safari/&quot;&gt;safari&lt;/a&gt; I had problems getting used to &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.mozilla.org/products/firefox/&quot;&gt;firefox&lt;/a&gt; again.  Luckily, &lt;a href=&quot;https://addons.mozilla.org/extensions/authorprofiles.php?application=firefox&amp;amp;id=2318&quot;&gt;some kind soul&lt;/a&gt; has created an extension called &lt;a href=&quot;https://addons.mozilla.org/extensions/moreinfo.php?application=firefox&amp;amp;id=785&quot;&gt;Tab X&lt;/a&gt; which basically replicates the safari close button behaviour in firefox, albeit at the opposite side of the tab.  That&amp;#8217;s cool.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

        <title>Tadalist bookmarklet</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#8217;ve been aware of, and used periodically, &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.tadalists.com&quot;&gt;tadalist&lt;/a&gt; from &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.37signals.com&quot;&gt;37 signals&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Over about the last week I&amp;#8217;ve started to use tadalist far more.  It&amp;#8217;s great but I really want a way to add items without having to use tada each time.  Apparently there &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.keeganjones.com/widgets/tada/&quot;&gt;used to be&lt;/a&gt; a &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.apple.com/uk/downloads/dashboard/&quot;&gt;dashboard&lt;/a&gt; widget (which would be handy as I use mac&amp;#8217;s at work) but it&amp;#8217;s been long lost.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#8217;d eventually like to develop a dashboard widget myself but until I get there I wondered about developing a &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bookmarklet&quot;&gt;bookmarklet&lt;/a&gt; to achieve similar effect.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I played around for a bit and came up with the following.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class=&quot;code javascript&quot;&gt;
var new_item=prompt(&#39;Add Item&#39;);
location.href=&#39;http://USERNAME.tadalist.com/item/add?list_id=LISTID&amp;amp;content=&#39;+encodeURIComponent(new_item);
alert(&#39;Added&#39;);
location.href=&#39;http://USERNAME.tadalist.com/lists/show/LISTID&#39;;
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It even kinda works, although if you press cancel when it prompts for the list text, it will add a new item of null, obviously&amp;#8230;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you really feel the need to try this, just copy this &lt;a href=&quot;javascript:var new_item=prompt(&#39;Add Item&#39;); location.href = &#39;http://USERNAME.tadalist.com/item/add?list_id=LIST_ID&amp;content=&#39;+encodeURIComponent(new_item); alert(&#39;Added&#39;); location.href=&#39;http://USERNAME.tadalist.com/lists/show/LIST_ID&#39;;&quot;&gt;link&lt;/a&gt; to your bookmarks.  You will need to replace &lt;span class=&quot;caps&quot;&gt;USERNAME&lt;/span&gt; with your username and &lt;span class=&quot;caps&quot;&gt;LISTID&lt;/span&gt; with the id of the list that you want items to be added to.  To find the id (I&amp;#8217;d suggest creating a new list like &amp;#8216;added from browser&amp;#8217;) click on the relevant list in tada and copy the number from the url after lists/show.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Oh yeah, you will also need to be logged into tada for this to work, otherwise you get a nasty looking &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.tadalist.com/no_page_here&quot;&gt;error page&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

        <description>&lt;p&gt;Well, having used &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.bloglines.com&quot;&gt;bloglines&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;/blog/2005-10-02-online-news-reader&quot;&gt;since&lt;/a&gt; the beginning of October, I&amp;#8217;ve just replaced it with &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.rojo.com&quot;&gt;rojo&lt;/a&gt;.  There were a couple of anoyances with bloglines &amp;#8211; the main one being that if you click on a folder, all stories are marked as read.  I realise that you can go through and keep them unread but if you click on a folder that contains &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.digg.com&quot;&gt;digg&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.slashdot.com&quot;&gt;slashdot&lt;/a&gt;, that&amp;#8217;s a lot of clicking when you might not have time right now.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The main reason for switching to rojo is that it &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Principle_of_least_surprise&quot;&gt;works as I would expect it to work&lt;/a&gt;, particularly regarding the way in which stories are marked as read.  It also seems to offer lots of cool tagging/social features that I&amp;#8217;m yet to explore.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

        <title>I don't know how to use the debugger</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;I currently use &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.ruby-lang.org&quot;&gt;Ruby&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.rubyonrails.com&quot;&gt;Rails&lt;/a&gt; all day, every day, at &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.revieworld.com&quot;&gt;work&lt;/a&gt;.  It&amp;#8217;s great.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now, I don&amp;#8217;t actually know how to use the Ruby debugger; I&amp;#8217;ve taken a look at it in the past and am sure I could use it; it&amp;#8217;s just that I&amp;#8217;ve never had the need.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As with lots of things, I&amp;#8217;ve been meaning to take a more detailed look for a while; mainly so that I could say &amp;#8216;I know how to use that&amp;#8217;.  Then, this morning, I realised that maybe it wasn&amp;#8217;t such a bad thing not to know.  If I can develop software that works&lt;sup class=&quot;footnote&quot; id=&quot;fnr1&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn1&quot;&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; without the help of the debugger&lt;sup class=&quot;footnote&quot; id=&quot;fnr2&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn2&quot;&gt;2&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; then, unless the need arises, why bother?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;footnote&quot; id=&quot;fn1&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fnr1&quot;&gt;&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/a&gt; It works when the tests pass.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;footnote&quot; id=&quot;fn2&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fnr2&quot;&gt;&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/a&gt; But very much with the help of unit tests.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

        <title>PwdHash</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;I read about this &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.pwdhash.com&quot;&gt;concept&lt;/a&gt; and associated &lt;a href=&quot;https://addons.mozilla.org/extensions/moreinfo.php?id=1033&quot;&gt;firefox plugin&lt;/a&gt; a while back but then promptly forgot about it.  I came across it again recently and decided to take a more detailed look.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Currently, you probably either have&amp;#8230;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;a different password for each website to which you have membership.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;a handful of passwords, some more secure than others depending on the type of websites they are for.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;one password for all of the websites that you are a member of.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the first and second instance, purely due to the volume, there&amp;#8217;s a good chance that these passwords are written down somewhere.  This is bad.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the third instance, you are opening yourself up to lots of problems if your single password is compromised.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PwdHash is a solution that allows you to have a different password for each of the websites that you are subscribed to, whilst allowing you to remember just one.  It does this by creating a hash based on your &amp;#8216;password&amp;#8217; and the url of the site you are visiting.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is perfectly possible to do this manually and use a desktop app or command line tool to generate the hashed password for a given site.  However, this would be a real pain if you are constantly visiting different sites that require authentication.  The firefox plugin with this service basically takes the pain out of this manual process.  Once installed, just press F2 or enter @@ in a password field and the hashed password will be created before submitting to the site.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If the plugin doesn&amp;#8217;t work or you are on a shared computer, you can always just use the javascript utility on the pwdhash.com site to generate the same hashed password.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To summarise, I&amp;#8217;ve installed the plugin and have started changing some of my passwords over to their hashed counterpart.  I&amp;#8217;ve only changed a couple of passwords and haven&amp;#8217;t yet had to use the javascript util but so far it seems pretty good.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#8217;m just going to grab a copy of the javascript source and place it &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.strongspace.com&quot;&gt;some place safe&lt;/a&gt; just in case&amp;#8230;&lt;/p&gt;</description>

        <title>dabble db initial thoughts</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#8217;ve been following the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.smallthought/blog&quot;&gt;blog&lt;/a&gt; for &lt;a href=&quot;http://dabbledb.com/about/&quot;&gt;dabbledb&lt;/a&gt; from &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.smallthought.com/&quot;&gt;smallthought&lt;/a&gt;.  I was initially excited about the promise of this software having read about it in a &lt;a href=&quot;http://chadfowler.com/index.cgi/Computing/LongTailTriesToWagTheDog&quot;&gt;post&lt;/a&gt; by &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.chadfowler.com&quot;&gt;Chad Fowler&lt;/a&gt;.  It intends to replace those custom Excel/Access &amp;#8216;applications&amp;#8217; that are so pervasive in organisations of all sizes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Today I saw a &lt;a href=&quot;http://smallthought.com/blog/?p=13&quot;&gt;post&lt;/a&gt; on the dabbledb blog containing a link to a movie of the software being used.  Completely initial impression with no real knowledge behind it is that it looks far too complicated to take the market for which it is intended.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Having said that, I&amp;#8217;ll wait to see more movies and maybe be lucky enough to get to try it in beta before commenting further.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

        <title>'We will never ask for your security details...'</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;I saw &lt;a href=&quot;http://simon.incutio.com/archive/2005/11/09/orange&quot;&gt;this&lt;/a&gt; recently and it reminded of a call I had a couple of months ago from &lt;span class=&quot;caps&quot;&gt;HSBC&lt;/span&gt;.  The call came through on an 0845 number and the caller stated that he was from &lt;span class=&quot;caps&quot;&gt;HSBC&lt;/span&gt; and needed some security details before he could talk to me.  I immediately assumed that this was a hoax and wouldn&amp;#8217;t supply the details requested.  He didn&amp;#8217;t actually ask for my password but did request post code, date of birth and mother&amp;#8217;s maiden name.  I asked him what the call was concerning and he said that he couldn&amp;#8217;t tell me before I answered his questions.  I said that I wouldn&amp;#8217;t answer his questions and he started to &amp;#8216;issue me a warning&amp;#8217;.  I hung up.  I then immediately called &lt;span class=&quot;caps&quot;&gt;HSBC&lt;/span&gt;, stating that I&amp;#8217;d received this call and asking if they had any record of it.  The guy I spoke to this time said that it was very possible I&amp;#8217;d been contacted as I&amp;#8217;d gone way over my overdraft limit and there was a note on my account.  Oops.  It made me feel a bit bad for hanging up on the first guy but I&amp;#8217;m still not convinced they should have called in the first place &amp;#8211; a letter would be more appropriate in these days of such prevalent phishing and scamming.  Ho hum.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

        <title>Windows Adobe Acrobat Reader alternative</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;I just re-installed Windows XP on my laptop as it has been almost unusable for the last few months due to large amounts of software cruft.  I had a need to read a .pdf and didn&amp;#8217;t really want to install Adobe as it just feels a little too bloaty to me.  A quick google turned this &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.foxitsoftware.com/pdf/rd_intro.php&quot;&gt;little app&lt;/a&gt; up.  It&amp;#8217;s small, feels faster than Acrobat Reader (although that may be to do with the re-install) and is free.  So far so good.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

        <title>Typo admin broke!</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;I went to add a link to my bloglines public feed this morning and couldn&amp;#8217;t log into typo admin.  I double checked that my username and password were correct using the console and so took a look at the accounts controller.  Using some advanced debugging techniques (mmm render :text =&amp;gt; &amp;#8216;&amp;#8217;) I found that request.method was returning :&lt;span class=&quot;caps&quot;&gt;POST&lt;/span&gt; where the code was checking for :post.  I amended the controller and all now works.  I&amp;#8217;m just really not sure why it stopped working as nothing had changed!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Update Sun 6th Nov 14:26&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I originally tried to post this article yesterday but it would appear that the new method in the content controller was also broken &amp;#8211; checking for request.post? was not working as expected.  I&amp;#8217;ve just changed this to request.method == :&lt;span class=&quot;caps&quot;&gt;POST&lt;/span&gt; and it now works.  Really not sure what&amp;#8217;s going on though.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Update Sun 6th Nov 14:40&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Right then, it would appear that the &amp;#8216;method&amp;#8217; method of request had been changed from &lt;code&gt;env[&#39;REQUEST_METHOD&#39;].downcase.to_sym&lt;/code&gt; to &lt;code&gt;env[&#39;REQUEST_METHOD&#39;].to_sym&lt;/code&gt;.  This was in actionpack 1.9.1.  Checking the version on my laptop confirms that it should be the downcase variant.  I&amp;#8217;ve now changed it back so will see how it goes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Update Mon 7th Nov 08:45&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It would appear that it was actually me that changed the code in request.rb when I was trying to diagnose and fix some problems when installing &lt;a href=&quot;http://weed.rbse.com&quot;&gt;weed&lt;/a&gt;.  Oops.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

        <title>Setting up Typo from SVN Trunk</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;This is for &lt;a href=&quot;http://httpd.apache.org&quot;&gt;Apache&lt;/a&gt; 1.3 with &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.fastcgi.com&quot;&gt;FastCgi&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.ruby-lang.org&quot;&gt;Ruby&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.mysql.org&quot;&gt;MySql&lt;/a&gt; 4 and &lt;a href=&quot;http://subversion.tigris.org&quot;&gt;Subversion&lt;/a&gt; already installed on &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.freebsd.org&quot;&gt;FreeBsd&lt;/a&gt; 4.11 Stable.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class=&quot;code&quot;&gt;
$ svn checkout svn://leetsoft.com/typo/trunk typo
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the public directory, within the newly created typo directory, edit the dispatch.fcgi file, changing the #! (shebang) line to /usr/local/bin/ruby.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Create a database for the typo install.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class=&quot;code&quot;&gt;
$ mysql
mysql&amp;gt; create database typo;
mysql&amp;gt; quit
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Copy the default database.yml.example file in config directory to database.yml.  Edit the file with the mysql credentials for your server.  Ignore (possibly remove) the development and test sections of the config file as these are not required in &amp;#8216;production&amp;#8217;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Use the mysql script in the db directory to create database tables.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class=&quot;code&quot;&gt;
$ mysql -Dtypo &amp;lt; db/schema.mysql.sql
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;NB.&lt;/strong&gt; There is a mysql-v3 script as well.  As far as I can tell the only difference is the database engine (InnoDb by default and MyIsam in v3).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Add a new FastCgiServer to the Apache config (httpd.conf).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class=&quot;code&quot;&gt;
FastCgiServer /home/web/typo/public/dispatch.fcgi -initial-env RAILS_ENV=production
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Add a virtual host for this new site.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;To do&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Restart apache.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class=&quot;code&quot;&gt;
$ apachectl graceful
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That&amp;#8217;s it.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

        <title>Typo pings</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;I updated Typo last night to run from svn trunk, just to get the added benefit of pinging sites like &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.weblogs.com&quot;&gt;weblogs&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.technorati.com&quot;&gt;technorati&lt;/a&gt; whenever I publish an article.  All was running smoothly until I just tried to create the newsreader article.  On saving, I get a not very helpful Rails app error.  The logs didn&amp;#8217;t help an amazing amount either&amp;#8230;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It was at around this point that I remembered that my shared hosting account didn&amp;#8217;t actually allow for certain low level network access (e.g. &lt;acronym title=&quot;Internet Control Message Protocol&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;caps&quot;&gt;ICMP&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/acronym&gt;) from my virtual machine.  Sure enough, disabling the auto-ping option made the error go away.  Having looked a bit further it would appear that the articles were actually being saved but I was seeing the error when the ping request was timing out.  This has already been reported on &lt;a href=&quot;http://typo.leetsoft.com/trac/ticket/400&quot;&gt;typo trac&lt;/a&gt;.  I must admit I don&amp;#8217;t know the exact cause of the problem here but am guessing that the blog ping&amp;#8217;s require access to some network operation that I don&amp;#8217;t have permissions for&amp;#8230;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;update Fri 7th Oct&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mmmm, seems I was being stupid in my assumption.  The &amp;#8216;blog pings&amp;#8217; just transfer data over http, nothing lower than that.  As such, the problem must have been caused by a non-respondent ping server at the time I was trying to save.  In fact, I just created a new test article and enabled the pings and all worked fine.  Oops.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

        <title>Online news reader</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#8217;s been on my list for quite a while to check out online newsreaders in order to replace my flagging &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.sharpreader.com&quot;&gt;desktop client of choice&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This has been pushed up the list by my recent contract taking me away from my main machine for the best part of the week.  As such, I spent last night looking at some of the alternatives listed on &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_news_aggregators#Online_news_aggregators&quot;&gt;this&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.wikipedia.org&quot;&gt;wikipedia&lt;/a&gt; article.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#8217;m currently torn between &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.bloglines.com&quot;&gt;bloglines&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.bloxor.com&quot;&gt;blox0r&lt;/a&gt; and although bloxor was slightly ahead last night I&amp;#8217;ve actually been using bloglines more during the day today.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Blox0r is a &lt;acronym title=&quot;XML User interface Language&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;caps&quot;&gt;XUL&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/acronym&gt; app which means that it only runs in Mozilla browsers (I think).  This provides for a very rich and clean interface which suits me perfectly.  Unfortunately, I&amp;#8217;m just not 100% sure that it&amp;#8217;s doing exactly what I expect it to be doing &amp;#8211; a handful of feeds are not rendering as they should which makes me wonder what else may not be working correctly.  Hence my current persuasion toward bloglines, which although looks a little too &amp;#8216;full featured&amp;#8217; for my needs is at least rendering all of my feeds correctly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I also tested the following services last night, none of which seemed to come up to scratch.  Feed lounge actually looks very promising but is currently in a non public alpha so I&amp;#8217;ll have to wait a little longer on that one.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://reader.bloogz.com&quot;&gt;bloogz&lt;/a&gt; &amp;#8211; no opml import&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.newsgator.com&quot;&gt;newsgator&lt;/a&gt; &amp;#8211; maybe too &amp;#8216;commercial&amp;#8217; looking&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.2rss.com&quot;&gt;2rss&lt;/a&gt; &amp;#8211; too complicated, didn&amp;#8217;t actually know what to do&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://beanrocket.com&quot;&gt;bean rocket&lt;/a&gt; &amp;#8211; didn&amp;#8217;t import opml&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://feed-tank.com&quot;&gt;feed-tank&lt;/a&gt; &amp;#8211; rails, no categories, didn&amp;#8217;t import correctly&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.newsisfree.com&quot;&gt;news is free&lt;/a&gt; &amp;#8211; slightly too complicated&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.rss-feed.org&quot;&gt;rss-feed&lt;/a&gt; &amp;#8211; no opml import&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.rssfreaks.com&quot;&gt;rss freaks&lt;/a&gt; &amp;#8211; no opml import&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.waggr.com&quot;&gt;waggr&lt;/a&gt; &amp;#8211; pretty good, slight interface problems, import opml but no categories&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.feedlounge.com&quot;&gt;feed lounge&lt;/a&gt; &amp;#8211; looks good, still in alpha.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;</description>

        <title>Instiki-AR with sqlite3 on Windows XP</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#8217;ve used &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.instiki.org&quot;&gt;Instiki&lt;/a&gt; quite a bit for storing what are essentially notes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Although it&amp;#8217;s been a true &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.rubyonrails.com&quot;&gt;Rails&lt;/a&gt; app for a while, due to it&amp;#8217;s use of &lt;a href=&quot;http://madeleine.sourceforge.net/&quot;&gt;Madeleine&lt;/a&gt; for object persistence, it required a couple of workarounds to host it using &lt;a href=&quot;http://httpd.apache.org&quot;&gt;apache&lt;/a&gt;.  Namely, run Instiki on &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.webrick.org&quot;&gt;WEBrick&lt;/a&gt; and then use mod_proxy in apache to forward requests for a given url to the webrick server.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Just a couple of days ago Alexey Verkhovsky (Instiki maintainer) &lt;a href=&quot;http://blade.nagaokaut.ac.jp/cgi-bin/scat.rb/ruby/ruby-talk/158000&quot;&gt;announced&lt;/a&gt; that a beta version of Instiki (&lt;a href=&quot;http://rubyforge.org/frs/download.php/6258/instiki-ar-beta1.zip&quot;&gt;Instiki-AR&lt;/a&gt;) running on &lt;a href=&quot;http://ar.rubyonrails.com/&quot;&gt;Active Record&lt;/a&gt; was available.  This basically means that Instiki can now be run directly via apache using &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.fastcgi.com/&quot;&gt;fast cgi&lt;/a&gt;, negating the need for mod_proxy and running in &amp;#8216;production&amp;#8217; on WEBrick.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I downloaded the beta this morning and had a quick play.  Initially I created a &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.mysql.org&quot;&gt;MySQL&lt;/a&gt; database and ran script/create_db to create the relevant tables in the database.  Everything worked as expected, although I didn&amp;#8217;t actually try to import any existing data.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#8217;ve read about &lt;a href=&quot;http://sqlite.org/&quot;&gt;sqlite&lt;/a&gt; quite a few times but have never got round to actually playing with it.  As such, I spent a short time getting Instiki-AR to use sqlite as it&amp;#8217;s backend.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;First off, I installed the sqlite3 gem (sqlite3-ruby 1.1.0 (mswin32)).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class=&quot;code&quot;&gt;
$ gem install sqlite3
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This was followed by downloading the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.sqlite.org/sqlitedll-3_2_7.zip&quot;&gt;sqlite dll&lt;/a&gt; and placing it in a directory in my path environment variable.  This was all that was actually required.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I used script/create_db to create the database files and tables as with the mysql implementation and everything just worked.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Update 17:30&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#8217;ve just played a little further and actually imported data from an existing instiki instance to the sqlite database.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;First of all, I created a copy of my original instiki with the madeleine storage in the storage directory.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the instiki-ar version I then ran the following (from Alexey&amp;#8217;s original email) to output a sql script that will import all of my wiki content into the database.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class=&quot;code&quot;&gt;
$ ruby script\import_storage -i d:\instiki -t d:\instiki-ar\storage\2500 -o i.sql -d sqlite
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I then downloaded the &lt;a href=&quot;http://sqlite.org/sqlite-3_2_7.zip&quot;&gt;sqlite3&lt;/a&gt; utility to administer sqlite databases.  I placed this in a directory included in my path environment variable.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Start sqlite3 with the location of the production database as the argument.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class=&quot;code&quot;&gt;
$ sqlite3 db\prod.db
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Execute the i.sql script to import all of the data to sqlite.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class=&quot;code&quot;&gt;
sqlite&amp;gt; .read i.sql
sqlite&amp;gt; .quit
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That&amp;#8217;s it.  My original wiki content is now in the AR version and everything seems to work great.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Note&lt;/strong&gt; To get instiki-ar from subversion.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class=&quot;code&quot;&gt;
$ svn export --revision 397 http://svn.instiki.org/instiki/branches/instiki-ar/
&lt;/pre&gt;</description>

        <title>Zen ADSL/Dial-up account can't be used at the same time</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;This may be obvious to others&amp;#8230;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Last night I was trying to connect to my home PC remotely via &lt;span class=&quot;caps&quot;&gt;SSH&lt;/span&gt;.  This usually works fine but wasn&amp;#8217;t last night.  I assumed that it was the &lt;span class=&quot;caps&quot;&gt;ADSL&lt;/span&gt; connection at home playing up and gave up for the evening.  On arrival home this morning I found that everything was working as expected (from within the Lan).  I then dialled out and experienced the same problems (not being able to connect remotely).  I tried another dial-up connection (which wasn&amp;#8217;t working last night) and this time the remote access worked fine.  After a few more tests, it appears that by connecting to my &lt;span class=&quot;caps&quot;&gt;ISP&lt;/span&gt; (&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.zenadsl.co.uk&quot;&gt;Zen&lt;/a&gt;) via dial-up using the same account as my &lt;span class=&quot;caps&quot;&gt;ADSL&lt;/span&gt;, my &lt;span class=&quot;caps&quot;&gt;ADSL&lt;/span&gt; Internet connectivity is disrupted.  It doesn&amp;#8217;t actually drop the connection (according to the status on the router), rather just does not transmit/receive any traffic.  Lesson learned &amp;#8211; don&amp;#8217;t use my Zen dial-up account when I am expecting my &lt;span class=&quot;caps&quot;&gt;ADSL&lt;/span&gt; to be active.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

        <title>Set background transparency in GIMP</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#8217;m very much &lt;strong&gt;not&lt;/strong&gt; a graphical person but when forced to dabble in any kind of image manipulation have always tried to use &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.gimp.org/&quot;&gt;The &lt;span class=&quot;caps&quot;&gt;GIMP&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, over any commercial offerings.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Just this afternoon I&amp;#8217;ve spent some time trying to make the background of a very simple image transparent.  The image is a filled shape on a white background.  I wanted the white background to be transparent.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I &lt;em&gt;think&lt;/em&gt; I&amp;#8217;ve finally found the best way to achieve this but may be way off mark.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Open the original image (jpeg image in this case).&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Use the &amp;#8216;magic wand&amp;#8217; (Select contiguous regions) and select the coloured shape.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Move the selected shape to the side of the image.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;In the Layers view you should now have a new &amp;#8216;Floating Selection (Floated Layer)&amp;#8217;.  Right click on this layer and select &amp;#8216;New layer&amp;#8217;.  This converts the transient layer into a real layer.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Click on the background layer to &amp;#8216;select&amp;#8217; the background of the image.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Select Layer &amp;gt; Transparency &amp;gt; Add Alpha Channel.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;We can now set the background to transparent by using Layer &amp;gt; Transparency &amp;gt; Colour to Alpha and selecting our background colour (white in my case) as the From colour.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Click Ok to set the background to transparent.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Click on the Floated Layer (this is what the layer will be called unless you renamed it) to display it to the side of the image.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Click the cross-hair (Move layers &amp;amp; selections) tool and move the shape onto the now transparent background.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;That&amp;#8217;s it, apart from saving the image in a format that either saves the layers (.xcf at least, maybe more) or at least deals with transparency (.gif and .png).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Update 18:07&lt;/strong&gt; It seems that anything over and above simple shapes as I had and this practice fails because it&amp;#8217;s not easy to initially cut the &amp;#8216;foreground&amp;#8217; image out.  But then again, maybe that&amp;#8217;s just because I don&amp;#8217;t know how to effectively &amp;#8216;cut&amp;#8217; images&amp;#8230;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description>

        <title>Netgear WPN824 disappointment</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#8217;ve installed a handful of wireless networks over the years and have always gone for &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.netgear.co.uk&quot;&gt;Netgear&lt;/a&gt; products due to price and my perceived quality of the items.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I recently had another wireless network to install which was to span a house and an office at the end of the garden.  Having looked at the latest Netgear offerings I decided upon the &lt;a href=&quot;http://netgear.co.uk/rangemax_wirelessrouter_wpn824.php&quot;&gt;WPN824&lt;/a&gt;.  This was mainly due to the boasts of &amp;#8220;Network range extended by up to 400 feet&amp;#8221;.  Although the item was slightly more expensive (¬£73.91 ex Vat at time of writing&lt;sup class=&quot;footnote&quot; id=&quot;fnr1&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn1&quot;&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;) than the alternatives, I was figuring on not having to buy additional antennae for the individual computers and therefore saving that way.  The first problem I had was that I had mis-interpreted the device as an &lt;span class=&quot;caps&quot;&gt;ADSL&lt;/span&gt; router rather than a Broadband router.  Because of this oversight I had to purchase an additional &lt;span class=&quot;caps&quot;&gt;ADSL&lt;/span&gt; Ethernet Modem (&lt;a href=&quot;http://netgear.co.uk/wired_adsl_router_dg632.php&quot;&gt;Netgear DG632&lt;/a&gt;) for ¬£36.45 ex Vat at the time of writing.  This was already going over budget.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On installation I was greeted with very dissapointing results.  I was using &lt;a href=&quot;http://netgear.co.uk/rangemax_wirelesspci_wpn311.php&quot;&gt;Netgear WPN311&lt;/a&gt; cards in each desktop and the wireless router was placed equidistant from each machine (albeit one had to travel through a couple of walls and the other through open air and wooden divides).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I tried all of the channels, with and without encryption and selecting the network types (b, g, b &amp;amp; g, 108MB only), all to no avail.  I was getting a signal but not one that was strong and consistent enough to work with.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The money I thought I was saving by buying the more expensive router was about to disapear with the addition of a &lt;a href=&quot;http://solwise.co.uk/wireless-indoorantenna-omni-105os.htm&quot;&gt;5db omni-direction antennae&lt;/a&gt; for each of the desktop machines.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With the antennae added, wireless performance was ok, although only really when running at a max of 54Mbs (i.e. I was still not able to take advantage of the 108Mbs speeds).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I still wasn&amp;#8217;t amazingly happy with this performance and so obtained a &lt;a href=&quot;http://netgear.co.uk/wireless_adslrouter_dg834g.php&quot;&gt;Netgear DG834G&lt;/a&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;caps&quot;&gt;ADSL&lt;/span&gt;/Wireless router combo.  This was installed in place of the WPN824/DG632 pair and to my slight surprise both faster network speeds and better consistency prevailed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#8217;m currently in the process of sending the WPN824/DG632 units back to eBuyer on the basis that they (well, the WPN824 at least) do not live up to their promises.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As indicated at the top of the article, I&amp;#8217;m generally pleased with Netgear products but have been let down by the exagerated promises of this particular device.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mini-disclaimer: This is based only on my experience with the product.  Your experience may vary.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;footnote&quot; id=&quot;fn1&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fnr1&quot;&gt;&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/a&gt; All prices are from www.ebuyer.com&lt;/p&gt;</description>

        <title>Remote Control Software</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#8217;ve always preferred &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.tightvnc.com&quot;&gt;TightVNC&lt;/a&gt; for remote control of other machines.  When run through an &lt;span class=&quot;caps&quot;&gt;SSH&lt;/span&gt; tunnel it provides secure, free, remote access.  The only problem is that it&amp;#8217;s not amazingly easy to talk someone through installing it remotely, what with the need to configure suitable &lt;span class=&quot;caps&quot;&gt;SSH&lt;/span&gt; software, firewall and TightVNC.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.fogcreek.com&quot;&gt;Fogcreek&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.copilot.com&quot;&gt;Copilot&lt;/a&gt; offers a commercial solution to this by having both parties communicate via a mediator.  This is fine but I&amp;#8217;m not keen on the cost.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In a search for a free (potentially open source) alternative I stumbled across &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.teamviewer.com&quot;&gt;Team Viewer&lt;/a&gt;.  I&amp;#8217;ve just tested this over the Internet, connecting two computers, both of which are behind firewalls, and it works fine.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I then started thinking that if there was a very simple P2P &lt;span class=&quot;caps&quot;&gt;VPN&lt;/span&gt;, we could just use standard TightVNC and get round the cost and difficulty problems.  It turns out that there is a free P2P &lt;span class=&quot;caps&quot;&gt;VPN&lt;/span&gt; in the form of &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.hamachi.cc&quot;&gt;Hamachi&lt;/a&gt;.  Although I&amp;#8217;ve not managed to test this over the Internet I have tested it connecting two different computers on a &lt;span class=&quot;caps&quot;&gt;LAN&lt;/span&gt; (one of which is in VM Ware).  I also managed to successfully get TightVNC working, after opening the relevant port (5900) in the target machine.  For some reason Remote Desktop wouldn&amp;#8217;t work &amp;#8211; it seemed to connect but just left me with a black screen &amp;#8211; but I was happy enough with Tight &lt;span class=&quot;caps&quot;&gt;VNC&lt;/span&gt; anyway.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

        <title>Typo flickr problems</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;I initially had this running on typo 2.5.5 but the flickr integration into the sidebar didn&amp;#8217;t seem to work &amp;#8211; unless I was doing something stupid which is entirely possible.  I applied patches from changesets 596 and 632 to no avail, so decided to export the trunk from svn and try that.  I still have the same problems which is slightly frustrating.  The db migrations built into the admin interface as amazing though.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;It would appear that it was my ignorance that was causing the flickr syndication problems.  I wasn&amp;#8217;t entering the feed url correctly.  I&amp;#8217;m wondering though, whether there should be some docs on the format of the feed url &amp;#8211; I had to look at the flickr.rb source to find the format, and then search unrelated websites to find my actual flickr nsid&lt;/i&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Having got the flickr syndication working I&amp;#8217;ve not reverted back to typo stable 2.5.5.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description>

        <title>Linspire</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;Apparently due to confusion caused by the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.freespire.org/&quot;&gt;freespire&lt;/a&gt; project, &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.linspire.com/&quot;&gt;Linspire&lt;/a&gt; decided to give away &lt;a href=&quot;http://info.linspire.com/freespire/index.html&quot;&gt;free copies&lt;/a&gt; of their Linux distribution.  I downloaded it the other day and just this morning took a look at it running in &amp;#8216;LiveCD&amp;#8217; mode within VM Ware.  Initial impression is that it&amp;#8217;s trying far too hard to look like Windows and hides far too much from the user.  I guess this is for their target audience but it didn&amp;#8217;t feel right to me.  I may take the time to have a more detailed play in the future.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
