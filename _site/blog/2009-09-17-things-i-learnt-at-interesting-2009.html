      <h1>Things I Learnt at Interesting 2009</h1>
      <p>Some things I learnt at <a href="http://russelldavies.typepad.com/planning/interesting2009/">interesting 2009</a>. Note. Some of this stuff is probably made up. If you want to see what actually happened you should read the <a href="http://rooreynolds.com/2009/09/12/interesting-2009-forty-even-more-interesting-things/">coverage by Roo Reynolds</a> (in theory my numbers match the numbers in Roo’s list).</p>
      <ol>
        <li>Boats can fly.</li>
        <li>The kids of today will feel sorry for us because we don’t take steroids. <span class="caps">THEN</span> <span class="caps">THEY</span> <span class="caps">WILL</span> <span class="caps">DESTROY</span> US.</li>
        <li>We are all gentlemen.</li>
        <li>Cheating in computer games is good, as long as you don’t get caught.</li>

        <li>Stan Laurel’s dad invented theatre.</li>
        <li>God invented subduction zones for us to hide our nuclear waste in: they’re like giant dustcarts.</li>

        <li>Twitter can blow bubbles.</li>
        <li>Lilac doesn’t exist.</li>
        <li>Keyboards are string instruments (ok, so this is actually true but I had to think about it when it was being talked about, because I’m an idiot).</li>
        <li>r2d2 has been made into every product ever built. Apollo 22 was actually made to look like the little fella.</li>
        <li>Morse invented kazoos and chocolate.</li>
        <li>Maps are better when they’re a list of words, rather than, you know, a map.</li>

        <li>Francis Galton could smell maths.</li>
        <li>Children’s art is better than a lot of what’s in the Tate Modern.</li>
        <li>Magners isn’t cider.</li>
        <li>Origami is actually impossible and all origami seen on TV has been computer generated by a supercomputer running for weeks on end.</li>
        <li>It’s easier to buy strands of banana smell dna and upload them into yoghurt than it is to buy a banana flavoured yoghurt.</li>
        <li>Conductors love coffee, chocolate cake and david beckham.</li>
        <li>You can never record too much data about your daily life.</li>
        <li>Breast shot is also the name of a waterwheel.</li>
        <li>Cartoons are like films that play at about 1 frame per second for 6 frames.</li>
        <li>India has superpowers.</li>
        <li>Burn giant wooden men or kill goats. It’s up to you.</li>
        <li>Writing a book takes ages so make sure you pick a fairly general topic (social web apps, or religion, I guess).</li>
        <li>Having imaginary ponies doesn’t stop you from going on stage and talking about said imaginary ponies.</li>
        <li>Cycling around the UK takes you up someones wife’s lane.</li>
        <li>Bill and Ted, the musical, is being presented live in and around Oxford next year.</li>

        <li>Astrotagging is done by a little robot that comes out of your computer and sits on your desk.</li>
        <li>1. Make clothes, 2. Make <span class="caps">TED</span> clone, 3. You’re done.</li>
        <li>France has the only bullet viewing platform, on top of the Eiffel tower.</li>
        <li>Sunsets are caused by the sun disappearing.</li>
      </ol>
      <p>All in all it was a great, and inspiring, day.</p>
