I’m tired so I’ll keep this short… If you can see this post then it
means that I haven’t broken anything (well, it means I haven’t broken
the rss feed anyway). I still have lots to do but [eating my own
dogfood](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eat_one's_own_dog_food) should
give me a reason to keep improving.
