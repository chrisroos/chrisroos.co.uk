  Tim Pope's, ["A Note About Git Commit Messages"](http://tbaggery.com/2008/04/19/a-note-about-git-commit-messages.html) suggests that we should split our git commit message into subject and body, with a newline between the two. Tim lists some tools that make use of this split and I thought I'd follow that with some screenshots showing how this convention is used in four fairly common (well, I use them) git tools.

  ## [GitHub for Mac](http://mac.github.com/)

  ### With a long commit message on a single line
