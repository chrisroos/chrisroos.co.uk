I've created a simple "mongrel":http://mongrel.rubyforge.org/ server that allows you to upload text files for subsequent deletion and retrieval.  If it sounds pretty pointless, that's because it is...currently.  I wonder though, if the basic premise couldn't be used to create some text-transformation tools.  I'm thinking of really simple tools that might spell-check a text file, or convert text from "textile":http://www.textism.com/tools/textile/ to html.  My end goal would be to have lots of super simple tools that I can chain together to use as a blogging platform, removing my current dependence on "typo":http://trac.typosphere.org/.

I've made the "server":http://chrisroos.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/text_file_server/server.rb slightly more complex than it needs to be by imposing some artificial constraints ("examples":http://chrisroos.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/text_file_server/server-test.rb).  The basic premise is that you "post":http://www.w3.org/Protocols/rfc2616/rfc2616-sec9.html#sec9.5 a text file, between 1 and 5000 bytes in size, with a "content-type":http://www.w3.org/Protocols/rfc2616/rfc2616-sec14.html#sec14.17 of "plain/text":http://www.iana.org/assignments/media-types/text/.  All being well, the server responds with "201 Created":http://www.w3.org/Protocols/rfc2616/rfc2616-sec10.html#sec10.2.2 and the "location":http://www.w3.org/Protocols/rfc2616/rfc2616-sec14.html#sec14.30 of the new resource.  The resource is actually retrieved by "deleting":http://www.w3.org/Protocols/rfc2616/rfc2616-sec9.html#sec9.7 it - the contents of the file are returned in the "body":http://www.w3.org/Protocols/rfc2616/rfc2616-sec4.html#sec4.3 with a "200 OK" response.  I've tried to use the relevant "HTTP error":http://www.w3.org/Protocols/rfc2616/rfc2616-sec10.html#sec10.4 when resource creation fails.  The whole 'post' and 'delete' pattern for these transformations feels kinda "restful":http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Representational_State_Transfer, but I may be way off the mark.

I'm wondering how much of "yahoo pipes":http://pipes.yahoo.com/pipes/ could be replicated with lots of small, specific web servers.

Anyone have any thoughts on any of this?
