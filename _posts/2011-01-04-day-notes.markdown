  We, [Go Free Range](http://gofreerange.com), moved today.  We've spent the last 6 months or so with [Moo](http://uk.moo.com/), which has been great, but decided to take [Protein's](http://prote.in/) offer of our own room in their [Hewett Street](http://gofreerange.com/#contact) building.  It turns out we travel pretty light so it took all of about two hours to get moved and settled in.

  Once in, we attempted to get a handle on our work committments for the first part of this year.  Then we went for a pub lunch.  We deserved it.  Probably.

  [James A](http://interblah.net/), [James M](http://jamesmead.org/), [Jase](http://jasoncale.com/) and I finished the day supping coffee and chatting with a chap about some potential future work.

  Working out what we can and can't commit to is complicated slightly by our commitments to the [O2](http://www.o2.co.uk/) [hashblue](https://hashblue.com/) project.  We're meeting O2 tomorrow so should hopefully have a better idea after that.
