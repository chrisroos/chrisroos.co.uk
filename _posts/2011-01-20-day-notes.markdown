I popped my bike into [On your bike](http://www.onyourbike.com/) so that they can add MORE POWER.

I spent a good few hours looking through a project in order to evaluate whether it'd be useful to continue development or whether to start over.

I spent a little while writing about some [cURL oddness with 302s and changing http methods](https://github.com/chrisroos/http-302-curl-test) that I noticed quite a while ago.

I booked a place in the [Snowdonia Slateman Triathlon](http://www.snowdoniaslateman.com/) after getting some really helpful advice from one of the organisers.  Now all I need to do is get a suitable bike.  Oh, and do some training or summit.
