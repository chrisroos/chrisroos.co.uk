  [Tom](http://tomafro.net/) and I spent some time on a call with O2 chatting about phone number re-use and [#blue](https://hashblue.com/).

  Tom and I investigated a problem with new messages not being imported into #blue.  It turns out that the default [Mongoid](http://mongoid.org/) behaviour is to 'fire and forget'.  So, although our messages were falling foul of a unique index constraint in Mongo, Mongoid was responding as if they'd be saved correctly.  See [Mongoid issue 642](https://github.com/mongoid/mongoid/issues/642) for a little more information.
