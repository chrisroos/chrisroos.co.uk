Continued investigating the [capybara-envjs](https://github.com/smparkes/capybara-envjs) error we ran into yesterday.  I got a simple failing test but need to simplify further before it can be submitted as an issue.

Worked with [Jase](http://jasoncale.com/) on a project we're working on for an upcoming conference.

Finished reading [Call of the wild](http://books.google.co.uk/books?id=QaM-AgAACAAJ).  I'd recommend it.  It's named after the [Jack London](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jack_London) book of the same name (mentioned in one of my favourite books/films, [Into the wild](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0758758/)) which happens to be available on [iTunes U](http://www.apple.com/education/itunes-u/).  [Call of the Wild on iTunes U](http://itunes.apple.com/itunes-u/call-of-the-wild/id384518080).
