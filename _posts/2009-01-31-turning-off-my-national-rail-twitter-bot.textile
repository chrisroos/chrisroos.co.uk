This actually happened nearly a year ago but I've only just got around to writing it up (I occasionally still get people following the natrailenq twitter user which prompted me to get this written).

I first wrote about a "national rail twitter bot":/blog/2007-07-24-train-times-by-sms-or-improving-national-rail-enquiries in July 2007 and then again in "February 2008":/blog/2008-02-28-national-rail-train-times-by-sms-again.  The premise was simple: you follow natrailenq on "twitter":http://twitter.com, send a direct message in a certain format and you'd get a list of train departure and arrival times.

Unfortunately, I received an email towards the end of Feb 2008 asking me to turn the service off because it contravened the "terms and conditions":http://nationalrail.co.uk/contact/tandc/ on the "national rail":http://nationalrail.co.uk website.  Oh well, it was fun while it lasted.

Chris,

Just came across your blog and the integration work that youâ€™ve done with Twitter and our website.  Unfortunately our terms and conditions prohibit the use of our site in the manner you are using it and I have to ask you to stop, close down and remove any software of yours that uses information from nationalrial.co.uk.

Many thanks,
