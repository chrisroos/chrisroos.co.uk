I've used "this":http://gdisk.sourceforge.net/ for a while but haven't got round to mentioning it.

Basically, it uses a "gmail":http://mail.google.com account (curently offering around 2.7GB space) as online storage, accessed seamlessly from this app.  Mac Os X only I'm afraid although I'm sure I've heard of Windows alternatives.

I'm not sure if gmail is still invite only, but if it is, and if someone reading doesn't have a gmail account, let me know as I have plenty of invites.
