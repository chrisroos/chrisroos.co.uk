Are Tesco Entertainment the new
[Orange](/blog/2007-03-16-orange-orange-orange?) They might just be you
know. See, I’ve been sad and pathetic enough to
[record](http://chrisjroos.stikipad.com/unsubscriptions) details of
unwanted emails that I receive. So far [Tesco
Entertainment](http://chrisjroos.stikipad.com/unsubscriptions/show/tesco-entertainment),
bless ’em, have been unable to remove me from their mailing list for 90
days. I thought I’d write them a little email to, you know, ask them to
stop spamming me.

<blockquote>

Here’s a list of emails you’ve sent me.

-   Received: 26-Jun-2007
-   Received: 11-Jul-2007
-   Received: 27-Jul-2007
-   **Unsubscribed**: 30-Jul-2007 (although it appeared that I wasn’t
    actually signed up to any offers…)
-   Received: 08-Aug-2007
-   Received: 21-Aug-2007
-   Received: 16-Oct-2007
-   I emailed you on 17th Oct:  
    “I unsubscribed from you guys on the 30th July 2007 (interestingly,
    my preferences suggested that I wasn’t actually subscribed to any
    mailings in the first place). Since then, you’ve sent me Tesco
    Entertainment emails on the 8th Aug, 21st Aug and 16th Oct1. Please
    stop. Cheers, Chris \[1\]

You’ll notice that I’ve received four emails since unsubscribing on the
30th July. I think three months is long enough to remove someone from
your spam list isn’t it? Oh, and you’ll also see I’ve emailed you in the
past too. It wouldn’t hurt to reply would it?

Cheers,

Chris

**Update Thu 15th Nov 2007**

I received a reply from Tesco.

<blockquote>

This phrase made me smile, “Thank you for telling us about this and
giving us the chance to put things right.”.
