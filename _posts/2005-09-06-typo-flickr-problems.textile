I initially had this running on typo 2.5.5 but the flickr integration into the sidebar didn't seem to work - unless I was doing something stupid which is entirely possible.  I applied patches from changesets 596 and 632 to no avail, so decided to export the trunk from svn and try that.  I still have the same problems which is slightly frustrating.  The db migrations built into the admin interface as amazing though.

<i>It would appear that it was my ignorance that was causing the flickr syndication problems.  I wasn't entering the feed url correctly.  I'm wondering though, whether there should be some docs on the format of the feed url - I had to look at the flickr.rb source to find the format, and then search unrelated websites to find my actual flickr nsid</i>.

<i>Having got the flickr syndication working I've not reverted back to typo stable 2.5.5.</i>
