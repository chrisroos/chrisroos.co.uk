I've used "putty":http://www.chiark.greenend.org.uk/~sgtatham/putty/ for all my ssh needs on windows for a long time now.  It's great but certainly lacks a little polish in some areas.

The one feature I really wanted was tabbed sessions.  After a little searching I came across a comment on this "post":http://www.jroller.com/page/thuss?entry=tabbed_terminals_for_windows_redux that mentioned an open source alternative called "poderosa":http://en.poderosa.org/.  I just got round to downloading and I must say that so far it looks great.

The only potential downside is that it relies on the .net framework (which I'd so far managed without) so it's not quite as light weight as putty but good none-the-less.
