Started using [1password](http://agilewebsolutions.com/products/1Password) to see whether it could replace my [gpg](http://www.gnupg.org/) encrypted text files (on [dropbox](https://www.dropbox.com/)) that I use to store passwords and the like.

Moved my Chrome Bookmarks to [Google Bookmarks](https://www.google.com/bookmarks).  I'm using the [Yet Another Google Bookmarks Extension](https://chrome.google.com/extensions/detail/jdnejaepfmacfdmhkplckpfdcjgbeode) to integrate these bookmarks with Chrome.
