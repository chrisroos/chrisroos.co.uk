  [James M](http://jamesmead.org/) helped me try to diagnose my broken [Joggler](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/O2_Joggler).

  [James A](http://interblah.net/) and I paired on getting our own Linode instance (hosting [gofreerange.com](http://gofreerange.com/)) re-provisioned using our [Puppet recipes](https://github.com/freerange/freerange-puppet).

  I booked some tickets for the [Uncaged Monkeys](http://blog.newhumanist.org.uk/2010/12/science-on-tour-robin-inces-uncaged.html) show in May.
