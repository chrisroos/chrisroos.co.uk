  I'm very much *not* a graphical person but when forced to dabble in any kind of image manipulation have always tried to use "The GIMP":http://www.gimp.org/, over any commercial offerings.

  Just this afternoon I've spent some time trying to make the background of a very simple image transparent.  The image is a filled shape on a white background.  I wanted the white background to be transparent.

  I _think_ I've finally found the best way to achieve this but may be way off mark.

  # Open the original image (jpeg image in this case).
  # Use the 'magic wand' (Select contiguous regions) and select the coloured shape.
  # Move the selected shape to the side of the image.
  # In the Layers view you should now have a new 'Floating Selection (Floated Layer)'.  Right click on this layer and select 'New layer'.  This converts the transient layer into a real layer.
  # Click on the background layer to 'select' the background of the image.
  # Select Layer > Transparency > Add Alpha Channel.
  # We can now set the background to transparent by using Layer > Transparency > Colour to Alpha and selecting our background colour (white in my case) as the From colour.
  # Click Ok to set the background to transparent.
  # Click on the Floated Layer (this is what the layer will be called unless you renamed it) to display it to the side of the image.
  # Click the cross-hair (Move layers & selections) tool and move the shape onto the now transparent background.
  # That's it, apart from saving the image in a format that either saves the layers (.xcf at least, maybe more) or at least deals with transparency (.gif and .png).

  _*Update 18:07* It seems that anything over and above simple shapes as I had and this practice fails because it's not easy to initially cut the 'foreground' image out.  But then again, maybe that's just because I don't know how to effectively 'cut' images..._
