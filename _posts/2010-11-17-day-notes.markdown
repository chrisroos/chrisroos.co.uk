Invoicing with [Kalv](http://kalv.co.uk/).

[James A](http://interblah.net/) and I had a play with [Rapid Task](http://www.rapidtask.com/) from the Google Apps marketplace.  I was after a simple group todo list.  Although this was quite nice it didn't do exactly what we were after so we discarded it.

Looked at some office space that would give us our own place.

Finished a little refactoring/tidying task on [#blue](https://hashblue.com/) with [James A](http://interblah.net/).

Switched from [Campfire](http://campfirenow.com/) to our own homegrown 'chat' app for internal use.

[Blogged about](http://blog.hashblue.com/post/1601203270/blue-and-bluebook-part-2) the unfortunate news that some of the [#blue](https://hashblue.com/)/[o2](http://www.o2.co.uk/) integration is going to have to wait until the New Year.
