  * Weekly meeting with O2.

  * The second team retrospective run by [Ben G](http://www.techbelly.com/).

  * Worked with [Kalv](http://kalv.co.uk/) to see whether we could get any useful data out of [JMeter](http://jakarta.apache.org/jmeter/) after our ([James M](http://blog.floehopper.org/) and I) somewhat unsuccessful attempts at getting anything useful [tsung](http://tsung.erlang-projects.org/), [httperf](http://www.hpl.hp.com/research/linux/httperf/) or [siege](http://www.joedog.org/index/siege-home).  Initial results appear positive, at least in the sense that we can actually get useful data.
