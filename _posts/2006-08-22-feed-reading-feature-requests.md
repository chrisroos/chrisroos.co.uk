A bit of an unordered list of features I’d like to see in a feed reader.
It’s very possible these exist in some readers that I’m not aware of
(I’ve moved from [desktop app on windows](http://www.sharpreader.net/)
through [bloglines](http://bloglines.com/) and
[rojo](http://www.rojo.com) to [feedshow](http://www.feedshow.com)).

-   Comment from within the reader. This would then automatically
    subscribe to a feed of the comments so that I could poll the
    updates.

<!-- -->

-   Notify me when feeds haven’t been accessible for a while. Maybe the
    address has changed or the reader cannot interpret the feed
    correctly; either way, I’d like to know so that I can make an
    informed decision about what to do.

<!-- -->

-   When a page offers multiple feed formats, I don’t want to be asked
    what format to subscribe to. The program should know the format it
    supports best and choose that. As I type this, I’m thinking that
    this is more difficult if there is a choice between full and summary
    content.

<!-- -->

-   If an existing article is ‘refreshed’ then diff it. If it hasn’t
    changed then I don’t want to see it. If it has changed, then
    highlight the changes for me.

<!-- -->

-   Show html in articles sensibly (rojo seemed to fail miserably on
    this front).

<!-- -->

-   Host a ‘live’ (i.e. dynamically generated copy of my feeds in
    opml) - I can’t think of any reason to have to import/export these.
