Happy New Year everybody peeps.

I started this little day notes thingy in October last year, did it for a bit, got behind and then gave up.  I'm going to start again and see if I can keep it up this year (I almost certainly won't).

We, at [Go Free Range](http://gofreerange.com), essentially took a couple of weeks off over Christmas.  It was good.

Anyway, that's enough about last year.  I want to try to do more physical stuff this year.  To that end I've entered the [Newham London 10k](http://www.newhamlondonrun.org/Events/Newham/Default.aspx) and the [2 mile Great East swim](http://www.greatswim.org/Events/British-Gas-Great-East-Swim/AboutThe2Miles.aspx).  I'm also very tempted by the [Snowdonia Slateman Triathlon](http://www.snowdoniaslateman.com/), I'm hopefully going to do the [National Three Peaks Challenge](http://www.thethreepeakschallenge.co.uk/) with [Sid](http://danielsiddle.co.uk/) and [Jase](http://jasoncale.com/) has talked about some big bike ride in Italy or summit.  Oh, and I did start (I saw a trainer *once*) 'training' for a Channel swim.  I'm not sure what to do about that yet...
