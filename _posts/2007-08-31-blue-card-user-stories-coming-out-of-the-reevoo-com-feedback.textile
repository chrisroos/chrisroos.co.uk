It took me a while, but I've come up with some "stories":http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User_story to represent the feature requests from the "reevoo.com":http://www.reevoo.com "feedback":/blog/2007-08-23-responses-to-reevoo-com-feedback.

I (well "Paul":http://www.po-ru.com actually) even took a photo to prove it.

We have a "planning game":http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Extreme_Programming_Practices#Planning_game next Tuesday (4th Sep) so we'll have to wait to see if any of them get in.

I've written the cards out in full below.  If anyone recognises one of their requests and thinks I've misrepresented it then feel free to let me know.

h2. Remove search filters

As a user of reevoo.com, I want to be able to remove filters in the same way that I can add them, so that I don't have to start my search again if I want to change my search criteria.

h2. Display scores of related products

As a user of reevoo.com, I want to see the scores of 'related products', so that I can instantly decide whether those products might be of interest to me.

h2. Display usefulness of reviews

As a user of reevoo.com, I want to know how useful the reviews are, so that I can get a feel for the 'importance' of a review.

h2. Favicon

As a user of reevoo.com, I want to immediately identify your favicon with reevoo branding, so that I can immediately pick it out in my search history and browser tabs.

h2. Recently viewed products

As a user of reevoo.com, I want to see a list of my recently viewed products, so that I can easily find my way back to the products I'm interested in.

h2. Scores obviously out of 10

As a user of reevoo.com, I want it to be obvious that the review scores are out of 10, so that I don't waste time trying to work it out and can, instead, find the products that I'm interested in.

h2. Product count on supercategory pages

As a user of reevoo.com, I always want to see the number of products appear next to the product category, so that I can easily scan down the list of categories.

h2. General comments

As a user of reevoo.com, I want to be able to immediately identify that the general comments are indeed general comments, so that I don't waste time trying to work out what they are and whether they're important.
