[Kalv](http://kalv.co.uk/) and I created a really simple project tracking tool thingy in [Google Spreadsheets](http://www.google.com/google-d-s/spreadsheets/).

Used Google's [drawing tool](http://www.google.com/google-d-s/drawings/) to create some diagrams.  It's a pretty darn neat little tool.

Went to/got drunk at the New Act Night at the [Comedy cafe](http://www.comedycafe.co.uk/).  It's free.  It was good.  You should go.
