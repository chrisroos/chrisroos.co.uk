  I'm almost 100% certain that there's a "bug":http://twitter.com/chrisroos/statuses/247143372 in the Hsbc Internet Banking site.

  My account is overdrawn yet the balance shows as positive when I download my transactions in either 'Money 98 onwards (ofx)' or 'Quicken 2002 (ofx)'.  I believe that section 3.2.9.2 of the "Ofx":http://www.ofx.net 2.1.1 spec explains that these balances should be shown as negative.

  I've tried to "email":http://www.flickr.com/search/?w=31365693@N00&q=hsbc+AND+ofx&m=tags and I've "tried":http://twitter.com/chrisroos/statuses/279942352 "to":http://twitter.com/chrisroos/statuses/279956472 "call":http://twitter.com/chrisroos/statuses/313632312 "hsbc":http://twitter.com/chrisroos/statuses/313656682.  Both to no avail.

  Does anyone know anyone that works at Hsbc and might be able to get a message to someone in development?  If not, what's the etiquette on facebook groups?  I notice that there a few hsbc groups - can I just post messages to them asking for help?

  I've gotten so used to dealing with "real":http://www.wesabe.com companies that I'd forgotten how the old world works.
