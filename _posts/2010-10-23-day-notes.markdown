  Spent the day on [The Original Tour](http://www.theoriginaltour.com/) buses in London with Mum and Dad for Dad's birthday.

  Spent the evening in the [Brazen Monkey](http://www.brazenmonkey.co.uk/) celebrating [Kalv's](http://kalv.co.uk/) 30th.  I popped my karaoke cherry singing Smells like teen spirit with [Tom](http://tomafro.net/).  I'm pretty certain we sounded exactly like [Kurt singing on Top of the Pops](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TBQ7jcEh2Qs).
