  I've updated my "previous":/blog/2006-12-24-curl-is-fast-becoming-my-favourite-toy curl/ruby script to automatically download my most recent transactions from Hsbc.  I created the original script as I had a couple of hours spare and wanted to see if I could do it.  The update has been driven by my continued use of "wesabe":http://www.wesabe.com.  Not only does it make my life a bit easier (which is, after all, the point of software) but the wesabe guys have suggested that they may be able to roll it into their client.  Cool.

  As an aside.  It really, really, really shouldn't be as hard as it is to automatically get a downloaded list of my transactions.  At least Hsbc offer transactions in "ofx":http://www.ofx.net format, unlike "egg":/blog/2007-04-01-converting-egg-credit-card-statements-to-ofx-for-upload-to-wesabe and "ing direct":http://chrisroos.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/egg-ofx/ing_direct.  Come on, The Banks, sort it out eh.
