[Kalv](http://kalv.co.uk/) and I paired on some message encoding oddness we're seeing with certain messages coming to us from the SMSCs.

[Tom](http://tomafro.net/) and I paired to investigate some spikes in load we were seeing on our application server after re-enabling a number of [#blue](https://hashblue.com/) users yesterday.  We're fairly confident we found at least two of the main offenders: removing conversations and cancelling accounts were both using grossly inefficient queries.  We've tidied these up and re-deployed.

I saw [Alexander](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alex_Ebert) (off of [Edward Sharpe and the Magnetic Zeros](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edward_Sharpe_and_the_Magnetic_Zeros)) at [The City Arts & Music Project](http://www.thecamplondon.com/).  It was great.  You can listen to the single, [Truth](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_atFMCUJ1o), on youtube.
