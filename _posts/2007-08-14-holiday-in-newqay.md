We’ve been camping in [Newquay](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Newquay)
for the past week. I just thought I’d post a few unstructured notes
about our time there.

-   It took about six hours each way in the car. Much better than last
    year’s nine or ten hour journeys each way.

<!-- -->

-   The weather was amazing. Given the miserable forecast before we
    left, it couldn’t have been any better.

<!-- -->

-   We stayed at [Trencreek
    campsite](http://www.trencreekholidaypark.co.uk). It was a good site
    about 15-20 minutes walk away from the northern end of town (coming
    out opposite [Tolcarne Beach](http://www.tolcarnebeach.com)). Along
    with the no single sex parties or [single
    people](http://ademweb.co.uk/blog/?p=750) rule, they didn’t have any
    card facilities and requested that you to park on the right hand
    side of your tent - maybe they could modernise just a little…

<!-- -->

-   Spent some time at [Fistral
    beach](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fistral_Beach), watching the
    [Ripcurl Boardmasters](http://www.ripcurlboardmasters.com) surfing
    competition, drinking
    [Fosters](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Foster%27s_Lager), and [body
    boarding](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bodyboarding). The South
    African commentator suggested that his mate took [the
    picture](http://img.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2007/08_01/whiteSWNS00808_468x331.jpg)
    of the [great white](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Great_white) in
    [South Africa](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_africa) a good few
    years ago (a story that seems to be confirmed by the
    [Guardian](http://www.guardian.co.uk/frontpage/story/0,,2144756,00.html)).

<!-- -->

-   Bought a [skimboard](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Skimboard) and
    fell off hard at least twice.

<!-- -->

-   Bought a bar for my [kite](http://www.peterlynnkites.co.nz) from
    [Airjam](http://www.airjam.co.uk).

<!-- -->

-   Had a good meal at the [Fistral Blue](http://www.fistral-blu.co.uk)
    restaurant and took some pics of the
    [sunset](http://flickr.com/photos/chrisjroos/1096710292/in/set-72157601392983638).

<!-- -->

-   Had a rushed meal at the
    [Maharajah](http://www.maharajah-restaurant.co.uk) restaurant. Tip
    to restaurant owners, asking us to finish our drinks in another
    restaurant across the street (even if it does belong to you) will
    not make us want to come back.

<!-- -->

-   Took in the [amazing
    views](http://flickr.com/photos/chrisjroos/1096871898/in/set-72157601392983638)
    along the coastal path from Newquay, via Porth to Watergate Bay for
    the Ripcurl unleashed music festival.

<!-- -->

-   Got to the festival site without any cash only to discover that
    there were no card facilities anywhere. Having walked for an hour
    and ten minutes to get there, we had to pay £10 for a cab to take us
    back, virtually all the way to the campsite, to withdraw some money.
    Ho hum.

At the festival, we saw:

-   [Funeral for a Friend](http://www.ffaf.co.uk). So much harder live
    than on their albums.

<!-- -->

-   [Ash](http://www.ash-official.com). I only really know their [old
    stuff](http://www.amazon.co.uk/1977-Ash/dp/B0000274GW) so it was
    cool that that was what they mainly played. It makes me wonder if
    that’s a sign that their newer stuff isn’t selling quite so well
    though…

<!-- -->

-   [Newton Faulkner](http://www.newtonfaulkner.com). Only caught the
    last three songs but was impressed with what I saw.

<!-- -->

-   [Scott Matthews](http://www.scottmatthewsmusic.co.uk). Boring.

<!-- -->

-   [The Guillemots](http://www.guillemots.com). Boring.

<!-- -->

-   [Paolo Nutini](http://www.paolonutini.com). Although the albums are
    pretty boring, he’s pretty cool live (having originally seen him at
    Isle of White festival). It was a bit of a shame that he was so
    drunk as his strong accent is hard enough to understand at the best
    of times.

<!-- -->

-   [Mat and Kim](http://www.mattandkimmusic.com). An amazingly
    energetic band from New York that played in front of maybe 100
    people in the [relentless](http://www.relentlessenergy.com) tent.

<!-- -->

-   [Wakeboarding](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wakeboarding) and
    [Wakeskating](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wake_skating) at the
    relentless tour.

<!-- -->

-   [Freestyle
    motorcross](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Freestyle_Motocross) with
    the [UK FMX](http://www.myspace.com/ukfmx) team.

All in all, a good week.
