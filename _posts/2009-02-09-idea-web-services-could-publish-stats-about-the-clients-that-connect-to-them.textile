summary:    I wonder if it'd help us determine whether or not a library is still active/compatible.

  It's not always obvious whether a client library is still compatible with the web service it was developed for.  I've seen this before with "flickr":http://flickr.com libraries and came across it again a couple of weeks ago when playing around with "Amazon Simple DB":http://aws.amazon.com/simpledb/.  I found three (although there are more) "ruby":http://www.ruby-lang.org/en/ clients that supposedly connected to the Amazon Simple Db service: "NY Times":http://nytimes.rubyforge.org/amazon_sdb/, "AWS SDB":http://rubyforge.org/projects/aws-sdb/ and "Right AWS":http://rubyforge.org/projects/rightaws/.  Unfortunately, without trying them (which, granted, wouldn't have taken too long) I had no idea whether they were going to work or do what I needed.  The fact that none of them appeared to support the latest version of the "request signing protocol":/blog/2009-01-31-implementing-version-2-of-the-amazon-aws-http-request-signature-in-ruby made me question how useful they'd be.  It struck me that it should be possible for the web service to know which client is being used to connect assuming the client supplies some sensible identifiable information (in the user agent http header for example).  If the provider was to publish this information (cient name/version, total requests, date of last request and probably some other useful info) then it should be possible to see which libraries still work with the web service.  Does anyone do this?  Does it actually sound like a sensible idea?
