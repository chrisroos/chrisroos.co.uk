  Started out tidying up the code I was using to illustrate a problem with [envjs](https://github.com/smparkes/env-js) so that I could use it to raise a [ticket](https://github.com/smparkes/env-js/issues/issue/23) and as another reason to discuss [bringing the johnson fork back inline with the main branch](http://groups.google.com/group/envjs/browse_thread/thread/ec2ba83d0fb3e57c).

  I created a simple [project](https://github.com/chrisroos/capybara-data-method-naughtiness) to expose one of the problems I see with Capybara knowing about Rails 3 specific behaviour in its rack_test driver.  I [raised a ticket too](https://github.com/jnicklas/capybara/issues/184).

  Spent about an hour working with [Kalv](http://kalv.co.uk/) to create an [app that exposes atom feeds from Google Docs](https://github.com/freerange/docalerts).
