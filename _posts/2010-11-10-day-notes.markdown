[Caffeine Monitor](http://cm.buildconf.com/) went live at [Build conference](http://buildconf.com/).

Paired with [James M](http://blog.floehopper.org/) to fix the non-deterministic asynchronous javascript [qunit](http://docs.jquery.com/Qunit) tests that [Jase](http://jasoncale.com/) and I looked at on Monday.

Paired with [James A](http://interblah.net/) on getting us using [Puppet](http://www.puppetlabs.com/) to provision our [#blue](https://hashblue.com/) staging server.
