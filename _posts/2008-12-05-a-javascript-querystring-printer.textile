  I've used this "mod rewrite":http://httpd.apache.org/docs/1.3/mod/mod_rewrite.html trick in the past to inspect the contents of various "apache":http://httpd.apache.org/ variables you have access to.

  <pre class="code">
  # Add this before any other rewrite rules in your apache config or .htaccess
  RewriteRule .* http://foo?request_uri=%{REQUEST_URI}&the_request=%{THE_REQUEST}&host=%{HTTP_HOST}
  </pre>

  Although useful, it's kinda hard to inspect the variables when they're in the "URL":http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uniform_Resource_Locator.  It dawned on me that it would be easier to see them if they were in a page in the browser itself.  So, I knocked up a simple little html page that uses javascript to extract the querystring key/value pairs and display them on the page.  It doesn't look very pretty but it makes it much easier to see the content of the variables.

  <del>The page is hosted in my "google code repository":http://chrisroos.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/querystring-printer/</del> and there's a splendid little screenshot below.

  <del>At the moment you'll need to host this file yourself, but if there's demand then I can probably make it publicly available somewhere.</del>  You can either host this file yourself or point at the "version in my utilities":/utilities/querystring-printer.
