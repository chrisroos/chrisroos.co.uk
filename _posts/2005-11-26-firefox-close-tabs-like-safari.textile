Having got really used to the location of the close button in "safari":http://www.apple.com/uk/macosx/features/safari/ I had problems getting used to "firefox":http://www.mozilla.org/products/firefox/ again.  Luckily, "some kind soul":https://addons.mozilla.org/extensions/authorprofiles.php?application=firefox&id=2318 has created an extension called "Tab X":https://addons.mozilla.org/extensions/moreinfo.php?application=firefox&id=785 which basically replicates the safari close button behaviour in firefox, albeit at the opposite side of the tab.  That's cool.
