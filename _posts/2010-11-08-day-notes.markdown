Worked with [Jase](http://jasoncale.com/) on some crazy failing tests in [#blue](https://hashblue.com/).  We think we narrowed the problem down to testing asynchronous javascript with [qunit](http://docs.jquery.com/Qunit).

A little [Caffeine Monitor](http://cm.buildconf.com/) tidying before the [Build conference](http://buildconf.com/).

Watched [Peter Kay](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peter_Kay) at the [O2](http://www.theo2.co.uk/).  T'was very good indeed.
