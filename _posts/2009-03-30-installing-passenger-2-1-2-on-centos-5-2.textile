I needed to upgrade "Passenger":http://www.modrails.com/ on our web server last week (so that we could run "Rails":http://rubyonrails.org/ 2.3 apps) but ran into a little problem getting it installed.

We're running "CentOS":http://www.centos.org/ 5.2 on our staging server.

<pre class="code shell">
  [root@rails-staging0 ~]# cat /etc/redhat-release
  CentOS release 5.2 (Final)
</pre>

The passenger gem installed OK but when I ran passenger-install-apache2-module I got the following error.

<pre class="code shell">
  ... other lines snipped ...

  /usr/bin/ld: skipping incompatible /usr/lib/libaprutil-1.so when searching for -laprutil-1
  /usr/bin/ld: cannot find -laprutil-1
  collect2: ld returned 1 exit status

  (See full trace by running task with --trace)

  --------------------------------------------
  It looks like something went wrong
</pre>

Searching for this error didn't yield any definite fixes but a couple of posts mentioned re-installing the apr-devel packages.  I tried apr-devel to begin with but was told that it was already up-to-date.

<pre class="code shell">
  [root@rails-staging0 ~]# yum install apr-devel
  ... other lines snipped ...
  Nothing to do
</pre>

I can't remember why but I tried apr-util-devel next which did result in the package being installed.

<pre class="code shell">
  [root@rails-staging0 ~]# yum install apr-util-devel
  ... other lines snipped ...
  Installed: apr-util-devel.x86_64 0:1.2.7-7.el5
  Complete!
</pre>

With this package re-installed I was able to go ahead and install the passenger apache module (i.e. passenger-install-apache2-module succeeded).

One slightly interesting/odd thing was that "yum":http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yellow_dog_Updater,_Modified reported that the same version (1.2.7-7.el5) of apr-util-dev was already installed.  The only difference after the re-install was that its status changed from 'base' to 'installed'.

<pre class="code shell">
  # before the re-install
  [root@rails-staging0 ~]# yum list | grep apr-util-devel
  apr-util-devel.x86_64                    1.2.7-7.el5            base

  # after the re-install
  [root@rails-staging0 ~]# yum list | grep apr-util-devel
  apr-util-devel.x86_64                    1.2.7-7.el5            installed
</pre>
