I finally got round to updating my blog template this weekend.  I based the new design on the "yui grids css":http://developer.yahoo.com/yui/grids/ in an attempt to provide the same look to users of different browsers.  In addition I've 'borrowed' some ideas from both the "w3c specification pages":http://www.w3.org/TR/xhtml1/ (the blue colour) and the "copyblogger wordpress theme":http://www.pearsonified.com/theme/copyblogger/ (mainly the header, seen on "Ben's":http://www.techbelly.com blog).

I've also created a really simple print stylesheet (it just removes the right nav) that should make it possible to print the content out if you so wish.

There's still work to do: the code snippets seem to break IE6 (not sure about IE7) but in general I'm pretty happy with the way it's looking.
