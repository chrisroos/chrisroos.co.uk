I often come across resources on the web that I’m interested in but want
to look at in more detail later. I currently use a combination of:
storing urls in text files, placing links in my
[backpack](http://www.backpackit.com), storing bookmarks in my browser
and, in the past, tagging links with
[to\_read](http://del.icio.us/tag/to_read) in
[del.icio.us](http://del.icio.us). I inevitably end up forgetting where
I’ve stored these ‘bookmarks’ and therefore miss out on that
resource[1]. In an attempt to consolidate places I can hide information,
I’ve created a todo bundle in del.icio.us that currently contains the
to\_watch and to\_read tags. Doing that today ensured that I remembered
to watch a [great
presentation](http://www.identity20.com/media/OSCON2005/) by [Dick
Hardt](http://blame.ca/dick/) on the subject of [identity
2.0](http://www.identity20.com). Cool.

[1] You could probably argue that because I forget about the resource, I
can’t have been *that* interested in the first place…
