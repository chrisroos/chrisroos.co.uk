Continued pairing with [James A](http://interblah.net/) to get our staging server provisioned with [Puppet](http://www.puppetlabs.com/).  We'd previously spent quite a while setting up puppet to provision our application servers as [CentOS](http://www.centos.org/) on [AWS](http://aws.amazon.com/).  The work to migrate [#blue](https://hashblue.com/) to AWS was put on hold yet we didn't want to lose our investment in puppet so we decided to make the relevant changes so that we could use [our scripts](https://github.com/freerange/freerange-puppet) to provision our [ubuntu](http://www.ubuntu.com/) staging server.
