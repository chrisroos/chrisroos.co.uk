[Kalv](http://kalv.co.uk/) and I continued to work on changing our [puppet](http://www.puppetlabs.com/)/[capistrano](https://github.com/capistrano/capistrano/wiki/Documentation-v2.x) recipes so that we could deploy as a single user.  This ended up taking quite a while to do.  We already had a 'freerange::user' definition that would create a user and set their SSH key but this wouldn't allow us to create a single user with multiple keys.  We ended up splitting the user creation from the SSH key assignment which allowed us to continue to create our individual user accounts and to create a generic user that all of us could log in as.

We fixed some other problems with our puppet deploy scripts that we came across (e.g. [monit](http://mmonit.com/monit/) wasn't being started and our users were set to use /bin/sh rather than something a little more advanced).

We fixed a problem where we were incorrectly using the newer version of the [Tinder gem](http://rubygems.org/gems/tinder) to broadcast builds and deploys.

Had a conference call with [o2](http://www.o2.co.uk/) where we got some slightly [disappointing news](http://blog.hashblue.com/post/1601203270/blue-and-bluebook-part-2).
