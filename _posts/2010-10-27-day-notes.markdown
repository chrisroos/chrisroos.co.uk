Paired with [Kalv](http://kalv.co.uk/) to investigate some problems with [#blue](https://hashblue.com/) where certain bits of the site didn't work without Javascript, even though we thought we had tests for exactly the case where javascript *was* disabled.  It turns out that Capybara does some evilness in [simulating javascript behaviour](https://github.com/jnicklas/capybara/commit/58d4d0caf7d4fad5519033e9bfd0786146750a13) when it detects special [data-* attributes](http://dev.w3.org/html5/spec/elements.html#embedding-custom-non-visible-data-with-the-data-attributes) that [Rails](http://rubyonrails.org/) emits.  Kalv's written more in [Stop being clever Capybara](http://kalv.co.uk/2010/10/27/stop-being-clever-capybara/).
