It bugs me when I’m unable to cancel accounts I have for various online
services. I guess that I’ve possibly become annoyed by it because lots
of the [more](http://www.backpackit.com)
[recent](http://www.basecamphq.com) ([cool](http://www.blinksale.com))
[offerings](http://www.strongspace.com) make it very easy to cancel.

I was initially aiming this rant at [yahoo](http://www.yahoo.com) as
I’ve had a user there for about seven years (hmm, that seems too long
but I’m pretty certain it’s correct) and didn’t think I could cancel it.
It would actually appear that I can cancel it but they still make it
relatively difficult to do (go to help, click on article, follow link
and then cancel).

Actually, I just changed the title of the post from **I should be able
to close online accounts** to it’s present form due to the yahoo finding
(although I’m pretty certain there are lots of other services that don’t
allow for cancelling).
