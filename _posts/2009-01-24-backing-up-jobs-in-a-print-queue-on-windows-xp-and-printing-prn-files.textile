I was asked to look at a Windows XP computer that had some jobs stuck in the print queue (the printer was reporting an error).  I added the same printer for a second time to check that it did still work; which it did.  Having done that I needed some way to transfer the jobs in the 'stuck' queue to the new printer device.  This proved trickier than expected but I managed to get there in the end.  I changed the printer port of the 'stuck' printer to file: (printer properties > ports) and printed each job in turn to a .prn file.  I deleted the dodgy printer device and then used this "Print File":http://www.lerup.com/printfile/ utility to print those .prn files using the good printer device.  The end.
