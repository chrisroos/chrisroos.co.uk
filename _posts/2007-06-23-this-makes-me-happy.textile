A "local blogger":http://birchington.blogspot.com/ forwards a "request":http://birchington.blogspot.com/2007/06/unusual-request.html he's received from a visiting pilot for photos to be taken of him practising at our "local airstrip":http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kent_International_Airport.  I duly "obliged":http://www.flickr.com/photos/chrisjroos/sets/72157600450060497/ (not hard as I live under the flight path) as has "one other":http://www.flickr.com/photos/doverpast/sets/72157600449864913/ so far.  The Internet is great isn't it.
