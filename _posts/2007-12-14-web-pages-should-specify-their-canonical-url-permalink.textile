I've been using "del.icio.us":http://del.icio.us to record items on "ebay":http://www.ebay.co.uk that I'm interested in.  The problem is that each ebay page can have multiple URLs - none of which redirect to the canonical version.  I can end up tagging the same listing twice if I happen to visit it with two different URLs - this is annoying.  It wouldn't be hard for them to either redirect to the canonical version or just add a <code><link rel="bookmark" ... /></code> tag to the document.  This way, I could ensure that I was always bookmarking the same version (even modifying the del.icio.us plugin if necessary).

This isn't just a problem for ebay: lots of sites duplicate their content on multiple URLs (hello retailers).  Maybe in the short term we could come up with some rules for turning any given URL on a specific site into its canonical representation.  That sounds like a nice, useful, little service to me.  Can someone build it for me please?
